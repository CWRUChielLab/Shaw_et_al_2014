	abstract = {Skeletal muscle fibre size is highly variable, and while diffusion appears to limit maximal fibre size, there is no paradigm for the control of minimal size. The optimal fibre size hypothesis posits that the reduced surface area to volume in larger fibres reduces the metabolic cost of maintaining the membrane potential, and so fibres attain an optimal size that minimizes metabolic cost while avoiding diffusion limitation. Here we examine changes during hypertrophic fibre growth in metabolic cost and activity of the Na+-K+-{ATPase} in white skeletal muscle from crustaceans and fishes. We provide evidence for a major tenet of the optimal fibre size hypothesis by demonstrating that larger fibres are metabolically cheaper to maintain, and the cost of maintaining the membrane potential is proportional to fibre surface area to volume. The influence of surface area to volume on metabolic cost is apparent during growth in 16 species spanning a 20-fold range in fibre size, suggesting that this principle may apply widely.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Muscular hydrostats, such as tongues, trunks or tentacles, have fewer constraints on their degrees of freedom than musculoskeletal systems, so changes in a structure’s shape may alter the positions and lengths of other components (i.e., induce mechanical reconfiguration). We studied mechanical reconfiguration during rejection and swallowing in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. During rejection, inedible material is pushed out of an animal’s buccal cavity. The grasper (radula/odontophore) closes on inedible material, and then a posterior muscle, I2, pushes the grasper toward the jaws (protracts it). After the material is released, an anterior muscle complex (the {I1/I3/jaw} complex) pushes the grasper toward the esophagus (retracts it). During swallowing, the grasper is protracted open, and then retracts closed, pulling in food. Grasper closure changes its shape. Magnetic resonance images show that grasper closure lengthens I2. A kinetic model quantified the changes in the ability of I2 and {I1/I3} to exert force as grasper shape changed. Grasper closure increases I2’s ability to protract during rejection, and increases {I1/I3’s} ability to retract during swallowing. Motor neurons controlling radular closure may therefore affect the behavioral outputs of I2’s and {I1/I3’s} motor neurons. Thus, motor neurons may modulate the outputs of other motor neurons through mechanical reconfiguration.},

	abstract = {In mollusks, statocyst receptor cells ({SRCs)} interact with each other forming a neural network; their activity is determined by both the animal's orientation in the gravitational field and multimodal inputs. These two facts suggest that the function of the statocysts is not limited to sensing the animal's orientation. We studied the role of the statocysts in the organization of search motion during hunting behavior in the marine mollusk, Clione limacina. When hunting, Clione swims along a complex trajectory including numerous twists and turns confined within a definite space. Search-like behavior could be evoked pharmacologically by physostigmine; application of physostigmine to the isolated {CNS} produced "fictive search behavior" monitored by recordings from wing and tail nerves. Both in behavioral and in vitro experiments, we found that the statocysts are necessary for search behavior. The motor program typical of searching could not be produced after removing the statocysts. Simultaneous recordings from single {SRCs} and motor nerves showed that there was a correlation between the {SRCs} activity and search episodes. This correlation occurred even though the preparation was fixed and, therefore the sensory stimulus was constant. The excitation of individual {SRCs} could in some cases precede the beginning of search episodes. A biologically based model showed that, theoretically, the hunting search motor program could be generated by the statocyst receptor network due to its intrinsic dynamics. The results presented support for the idea that the statocysts are actively involved in the production of the motor program underlying search movements during hunting behavior.},

	abstract = {The muscle I2 is a smooth muscle from the buccal mass of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica whose neural control, in vivo kinematics, and behavioral role have been extensively analyzed. In this study, we measured the activation and contractile dynamics of the muscle in order to construct a Hill-type kinetic model of the muscle. This is the first study to our knowledge, of Aplysia muscle contractile dynamics. The isometric force-frequency relationship of I2 had a frequency threshold of about 6-8 Hz, and its force output saturated at 20-25 Hz, properties that match the high frequency (20 Hz) bursts generated by the {B31/B32} neurons that innervate it. Peak isometric force was generated at about 118\% of the in situ relaxed length. These results and I2's estimated in vivo kinematics suggest that it generates maximum force at the onset of protraction. The muscle tension during iso-velocity lengthening and shortening was an asymmetric function of velocity. Short range stiffness and yielding responses were observed in lengthening, whereas muscle tension decreased smoothly in shortening. These visco-elastic properties suggest that the I2 muscle can serve to brake forceful retraction movements. A Hill-type model, parameterized from the measurements, captured many of the mechanical properties of I2. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the biomechanical significance of the muscle's neural control and provide a basis for simulation studies of the control of feeding behavior.},

Such heteroclinic connections are a structurally unstable phenomenon [4]. However, in the space {XG(M)} ⊂ X(M) of vector fields equivariant with respect to a symmetry group G, the situation can be quite different. We give an example of an open set U of topologically equivalent vector fields in the space of vector fields on 3 equivariant with respect to a particular finite subgroup G ⊂ O(3) such that each X U has a heteroclinic cycle that is an attractor.

Any dynamical mechanism underlying cognitive processes has to be reproducible from experiment to experiment in similar environmental conditions and, at the same time, it has to be sensitive to changing internal and external information.

We have used this interface to image the internal structures of the feeding apparatus (i.e. the buccal mass) of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica. The temporal and spatial resolution of the resulting images is sufficient to describe the kinematics of specific muscles of the buccal mass and the internal movements of the main structures responsible for grasping food, the radula and the odontophore. These observations suggest that a previously undescribed feature on the anterior margin of the odontophore, a fluid-filled structure that we term the prow, may aid in opening the jaw lumen early in protraction. Radular closing during swallowing occurs near the peak of protraction as the radular stalk is pushed rapidly out of the odontophore. Retraction of the odontophore is enhanced by the closure of the lumen of the jaws on the elongated odontophore, causing the odontophore to rotate rapidly towards the esophagus. Radular opening occurs after the peak of retraction and without the active contraction of the protractor muscle 12 and is due, in part, to the movement of the radular stalk into the odontophore. The large variability between responses also suggests that the great flexibility of swallowing responses may be due to variability in neural control and in the biomechanics of the ingested food and to the inherent flexibility of the buccal mass.},

Experimentally advantageous invertebrate preparations may be particularly useful for studies that seek to characterize the cellular mechanisms that make this possible. In these experiments, we study sensorimotor integration in the feeding circuitry of the mollusc Aplysia. We show that a premotor neuron with plateau properties, B51, is important for generating the radula closing/retraction phase of ingestive motor programs. When B51 is depolarized in semi-intact preparations, radula closing/retractions are enhanced. When B51 is hyperpolarized, radula closing/retractions are reduced in size. In addition to being important as a premotor interneuron, B51 is also a sensory neuron that is activated when the feeding apparatus, the radula, rotates backward. The number of centripetal spikes in B51 is increased if the resistance to backward rotation is increased. Thus, B51 is a proprioceptor that is likely to be part of a feedback loop that insures that food will be moved into the buccal cavity when difficulty is encountered. Our data suggest, therefore, that Aplysia are able to adjust feeding motor programs to accommodate the specific qualities of the food ingested because at least one of the neurons that generates the basic ingestive motor program also serves as an on-line monitor of the success of radula movements.},

Stimulating the I2 muscle in the radula rest position produces radula protraction. In addition, in behaving animals lesioning either the muscle or the I2 nerve greatly reduces radula protraction. 3. During buccal motor programs in reduced preparations, {B31/B32} and B61/62 fire preceding activity in neuron B4, whose firing indicates the onset of radula retraction. In addition, during both ingestion-like and rejection-like patterns the activity in the I2 nerve is correlated with protraction. 4. {B31/B32} fire at frequencies of 15-25 Hz. Neither {B31/B32} nor {B61/B62} elicit facilitating end-junction potentials ({EJPs)} and electromyograms ({EMGs)} in the I2 muscle. {EMGs} from {B31/B32} are smaller than those from {B61/B62.} {B31/B32} and {B61/B62} innervate all areas of the muscle approximately uniformly. 5. In behaving animals, {EMGs} consistent with {B31/B32} activity are seen in the I2 muscle during the protraction phase of biting, swallowing, and rejection movements. In addition, the I2 muscle receives inputs that cannot be attributed to either the {B31/B32} or {B61/B62} neurons, either because the potentials are too large, firing frequencies are too low, or a prominent facilitation is seen. Such potentials are associated with lip movements, and also with radula retraction. 6. {EMGs} were recorded from the I2 muscle during feeding behavior after a lesion of the I2 nerve. Animals that had severe deficits in protraction showed no activity consistent with {B31/B32} or {B61/B62}, but did show activity during retraction. 7. Our data indicate that the I2 muscle and the {B31/B32} motor neurons are essential constituents contributing to protraction movements. Activity in these neurons is associated with radula protraction, which occurs as a component of a number of different feeding movements. The I2 muscle may also contribute to retraction, via activation by other motor neurons.},

Different roles of neurons B63 and B34 that are active during the protraction phase of buccal motor programs in Aplysia californica. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 1305–1319, 1997. The buccal ganglion of Aplysia contains a central pattern generator ({CPG)} that organizes sequences of radula protraction and retraction during food ingestion and egestion. Neurons B63 and B34 have access to, or are elements of, the {CPG.} Both neurons are depolarized along with {B31/B32} during the protraction phase of buccal motor programs. Both cells excite the contralateral {B31/B32} neurons and inhibit B64 and other neurons active during the retraction phase. B63 and B34 also both have an axon exiting the buccal ganglia via the contralateral cerebrobuccal connective. Despite their similarities, B63 and B34 differ in a number of properties, which reflects their different functions. B63 fires during both ingestion and egestion-like buccal motor programs, whereas B34 fires only during egestion-like programs. The bilateral B63 neurons, along with the bilateral B31 and B32 neurons, act as a single functional unit. Sufficient depolarization of any of these neurons activates them all and initiates a buccal motor program. B63 is electrically coupled to both the ipsilateral and the contralateral {B31/B32} neurons but monosynaptically excites the contralateral neurons with a mixed electrical and chemical excitatory postsynaptic potential ({EPSP).} Positive feedback caused by electrical and chemical {EPSPs} between B63 and {B31/B32} contributes to the sustained depolarization in {B31/B32} and the firing of B63 during the protraction phase of a buccal motor program. B34 is excited during the protraction phase of all buccal motor programs, but, unlike B63, it does not always reach firing threshold. The neuron fires in response to current injection only after it is depolarized for 1–2 s or after preceding buccal motor programs in which it is depolarized. Firing of B34 produces facilitating {EPSPs} in the contralateral {B31/B32} and B63 neurons and can initiate a buccal motor program. Firing in B34 is strongly correlated with firing in the {B61/B62} motor neurons, which innervate the muscle (I2) responsible for much of protraction. B34 monosynaptically excites these motor neurons. B34 firing is also correlated with firing in motor neuron B8 during the protraction phase of a buccal motor program. B8 innervates the I4 radula closer muscle, which in egestion movements is active during protraction and in ingestion movements is active during retraction. B34 has a mixed, but predominantly excitatory, effect on B8 via a slow conductance-decrease {EPSP.} Thus firing in B34 leads to amplification of radula protraction that is coupled with radula closing, a pattern characteristic of egestion.},

	abstract = {What are the mechanisms of multifunctionality, i.e. the use of the same peripheral structures for multiple behaviors? We studied this question using the multifunctional feeding apparatus of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, in which the same muscles mediate biting (an attempt to grasp food) and swallowing (ingestion of food). Biting and swallowing responses were compared using magnetic resonance imaging of intact, behaving animals and a three-dimensional kinematic model. Biting is associated with larger amplitude protractions of the grasper (radula/odontophore) than swallowing, and smaller retractions. Larger biting protractions than in swallowing appear to be due to a more anterior position of the grasper as the behavior begins, a larger amplitude contraction of protractor muscle I2, and contraction of the posterior portion of the {I1/I3/jaw} complex. The posterior {I1/I3/jaw} complex may be context-dependent, i.e. its mechanical context changes the direction of the force it exerts. Thus, the posterior of {I1/I3} may aid protraction near the peak of biting, whereas the entire {I1/I3/jaw} complex acts as a retractor during swallowing. In addition, larger amplitude closure of the grasper during swallowing allows an animal to exert more force as it ingests food. These results demonstrate that differential deployment of the periphery can mediate multifunctionality.},

Behavioral protocols have been developed for both forms of associative learning, both of which increase the occurrence of biting following training. Because the neural circuitry that mediates the behavior is well characterized and amenable to detailed cellular analyses, substantial progress has been made toward a comparative analysis of the cellular mechanisms underlying these two forms of associative learning. Both forms of associative learning use the same reinforcement pathway (the esophageal nerve, En) and the same reinforcement transmitter (dopamine, {DA).} In addition, at least one cellular locus of plasticity (cell B51) is modified by both forms of associative learning. However, the two forms of associative learning have opposite effects on B51. Classical conditioning decreases the excitability of B51, whereas operant conditioning increases the excitability of B51. Thus, the approach of using two forms of associative learning to modify a single behavior, which is mediated by an analytically tractable neural circuit, is revealing similarities and differences in the mechanisms that underlie classical and operant conditioning.},

Resting oxygen consumption of isolated muscles ({VO2}, {µL/g} wet weight/s) measured polarographically at {30°C} was {\textasciitilde}20\% higher (P{\textless}0.05) in soleus (0.326 ± 0.022) than in {EDL} (0.261 ± 0.020). In order to quantify the specific contribution of Ca2+ cycling to resting metabolic rate, the concentration of {MgCl2} in the bath was increased to 10 {mM} to block Ca2+ release through the ryanodine receptor, thus eliminating a major source of Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ({SR)}, and thereby indirectly inhibiting the activity of the sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+-{ATPases} ({SERCAs).} The relative (\%) reduction in muscle {VO2} in response to 10 {mM} {MgCl2} was similar between soleus (48.0±3.7) and {EDL} (42.4±3.2). Using a different approach, we attempted to directly inhibit {SERCA} {ATPase} activity in stretched {EDL} and soleus muscles (1.42x optimum length) using the specific {SERCA} inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid ({CPA}, up to 160 {µM)}, but were unsuccessful in removing the energetic cost of Ca2+ cycling in resting isolated muscles. The results of the {MgCl2} experiments indicate that {ATP} consumption by {SERCAs} is responsible for 40–50\% of resting metabolic rate in both mouse fast- and slow-twitch muscles at {30°C}, or 12–15\% of whole body resting {VO2.} Thus, {SERCA} pumps in skeletal muscle could represent an important control point for energy balance regulation and a potential target for metabolic alterations to oppose obesity.},

Many of the cellular and synaptic elements of this {CPG} have been identified and characterized. However, the roles that specific cellular and synaptic properties play in generating patterns of activity are not well understood. To examine these issues, the present study developed computational models of a portion of this {CPG} and used simulations to investigate processes underlying the initiation of patterned activity. Simulations were done with the {SNNAP} software package. The simulated network contained two neurons, {B31/B32} and B63. The development of the model was guided and constrained by the available current-clamp data that describe the properties of these two protraction-phase interneurons {B31/B32} and B63, which are coupled via electrical and chemical synapses. Several configurations of the model were examined. In one configuration, a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential ({EPSP)} from B63 to {B31/B32} was implemented in combination with an endogenous plateau-like potential in {B31/B32.} In a second configuration, the excitatory synaptic connection from B63 to {B31/B32} produced both fast and slow {EPSPs} in {B31/B32} and the plateau-like potential was removed from {B31/B32.} Simulations indicated that the former configuration (i.e., electrical and fast chemical coupling in combination with a plateau-like potential) gave rise to a circuit that was robust to changes in parameter values and stochastic fluctuations, that closely mimicked empirical observations, and that was extremely sensitive to inputs controlling the onset of a burst. The coupling between the two simulated neurons served to amplify exogenous depolarizations via a positive feedback loop and the subthreshold activation of the plateau-like potential. Once a burst was initiated, the circuit produced the program in an all-or-none fashion. The slow kinetics of the simulated plateau-like potential played important roles in both initiating and maintaining the burst activity. Thus the present study identified cellular and network properties that contribute to the ability of the simulated network to integrate information over an extended period before a decision is made to initiate a burst of activity and suggests that similar mechanisms may operate in the buccal ganglia in initiating feeding movements.},

	abstract = {Rhythmic behaviors in neural systems often combine features of limit-cycle dynamics (stability and periodicity) with features of near heteroclinic or near homoclinic cycle dynamics (extended dwell times in localized regions of phase space). Proximity of a limit cycle to one or more saddle equilibria can have a profound effect on the timing of trajectory components and response to both fast and slow perturbations, providing a possible mechanism for adaptive control of rhythmic motions. Reyn [{“Generation} of limit cycles from separatrix polygons in the phase plane” in Geometrical Approaches to Differential Equations, Lecture Notes in Math. 810, Springer, New York, 1980, pp. 264–289] showed that for a planar dynamical system with a stable heteroclinic cycle (or separatrix polygon), small perturbations satisfying a net inflow condition will generically give rise to a stable limit cycle (see also [J. Guckenheimer and P. Holmes, Nonlinear Oscillations, Dynamical Systems, and Bifurcations of Vector Fields, 3rd ed., Appl. Math. Sci. 42, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1990]). Here we consider the asymptotic behavior of the infinitesimal phase response curve ({iPRC)} for examples of two systems satisfying Reyn's inflow criterion, (i) a smooth system with a chain of four hyperbolic saddle points and (ii) a piecewise linear system corresponding to local linearization of the smooth system about its saddle points. For system (ii), we obtain exact expressions for the limit cycle and the {iPRC} as functions of a parameter \${\textbackslash}mu{\textgreater}0\$ representing the distance from a heteroclinic bifurcation point. In the \${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}to 0\$ limit, we find that perturbations parallel to the unstable eigenvector direction in a piecewise linear region lead to divergent phase response, as previously observed [E. Brown, J. Moehlis, and P. Holmes, Neural Comput., 16 (2004), pp. 673–715]. In contrast to previous work, we find that perturbations parallel to the stable eigenvector direction can lead to either divergent or convergent phase response, depending on the phase at which the perturbation occurs. In the smooth system (i), we show numerical evidence of qualitatively similar phase specific sensitivity to perturbation. Having the exact expression for the {iPRC} for the piecewise linear system allows us to investigate its stability under diffusive coupling. In addition, we qualitatively compare {iPRCs} obtained for systems (i) and (ii) to {iPRCs} for the {Morris–Lecar} equations near a bifurcation from limit cycles to a saddle-homoclinic orbit.},

At 15 degrees C, {pH} 7 and an ionic strength of 0.2 M the rate at saturating Mg {ATP} (Vm) was 1.78 +/- 0.2 s-1 per myosin head (mean +/- {S.D.;} n = 6) and the Mg {ATP} concentration needed for half the maximal rate (Km) was 16.6 +/- 2 {microM.} The {ATPase} of fibres that had been stabilized by cross-linking with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimide ({EDC)} was also investigated. Cross-linking did not significantly affect the Vm or Km and these fibres proved useful for investigating the adequacy of the pyruvate kinase activity for regenerating hydrolysed {ATP.} Myofibrils were cross-linked with {EDC} or glutaraldehyde to prevent shortening. Their {ATPase} properties were investigated: the values of Vm were 0.85 +/- 0.18 (mean +/- {S.D.;} n = 14) and 0.82 +/- 0.05 s-1 (n = 6) and of Km were 18.0 +/- 2.8 and 12.4 +/- 2.4 {microM} respectively. The values of Vm and Km for {EDC} cross-linked myofibrils were fairly insensitive to ionic strength, the Km decreasing 40\% and the Vm increasing 50\% for a change from 0.2 to 0.3 M. This slight dependence on ionic strength is considered in relation to the ionic strength dependence of the elementary rate constants of the actomyosin subfragment-1 {ATPase} cycle.},

	abstract = {In the last few decades several concepts of dynamical systems theory ({DST)} have guided psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists to rethink about sensory motor behavior and embodied cognition. A critical step in the progress of {DST} application to the brain (supported by modern methods of brain imaging and multi-electrode recording techniques) has been the transfer of its initial success in motor behavior to mental function, i.e., perception, emotion, and cognition. Open questions from research in genetics, ecology, brain sciences, etc., have changed {DST} itself and lead to the discovery of a new dynamical phenomenon, i.e., reproducible and robust transients that are at the same time sensitive to informational signals. The goal of this review is to describe a new mathematical framework – heteroclinic sequential dynamics – to understand self-organized activity in the brain that can explain certain aspects of robust itinerant behavior. Specifically, we discuss a hierarchy of coarse-grain models of mental dynamics in the form of kinetic equations of modes. These modes compete for resources at three levels: (i) within the same modality, (ii) among different modalities from the same family (like perception), and (iii) among modalities from different families (like emotion and cognition). The analysis of the conditions for robustness, i.e., the structural stability of transient (sequential) dynamics, give us the possibility to explain phenomena like the finite capacity of our sequential working memory – a vital cognitive function –, and to find specific dynamical signatures – different kinds of instabilities – of several brain functions and mental diseases.},

We suggest that this difference, due to a separation in the time scales of the dynamics guiding neural processes and the overall behavioral expression, is a key point in understanding the implementation of cognitive processes in general. In this paper we use Structured Flows on Manifolds ({SFM)} to understand the organization of behavioral dynamics possessing this property. Next, we discuss how this form of behavioral dynamics can be distributed across a network, such as those recruited in the brain for particular cognitive functions. Finally, we provide an example of an {SFM} style functional architecture of handwriting, motivated by studies in human movement sciences, that demonstrates hierarchical sequencing of behavioral processes.},

In particular, it considers the formal basis of self-organized instabilities that enable perceptual transitions during Bayes-optimal perception. The basic phenomena we consider are perceptual transitions that lead to conscious ignition (Dehaene and Changeux, ) and how they depend on dynamical instabilities that underlie chaotic itinerancy (Breakspear, ; Tsuda, ) and self-organized criticality (Beggs and Plenz, ; Plenz and Thiagarajan, ; Shew et al., ). Our approach is based on a dynamical formulation of perception as approximate Bayesian inference, in terms of variational free energy minimization. This formulation suggests that perception has an inherent tendency to induce dynamical instabilities (critical slowing) that enable the brain to respond sensitively to sensory perturbations. We briefly review the dynamics of perception, in terms of generalized Bayesian filtering and free energy minimization, present a formal conjecture about self-organized instability and then test this conjecture, using neuronal (numerical) simulations of perceptual categorization.},

The material properties of either tissue sections or the whole stipe of four wave-exposed seaweeds, Durvillaea antarctica, D. willana, Laminaria digitata, and L. hyperborea, were tested in tension, bending, and torsion. Durvillaea has a very low modulus of elasticity in tension (Etension = 3–7 {MN·m−2)} and in bending (Ebending = 9–12 {MN} · m−2), torsion modulus (G = 0.3 {MN} · m−2) and strength (σbrk = 1–2 {MN} · m−2), combining a compliable and twistable stipe “material” with a comparatively high breaking strain (εbrk = 0.4–0.6). In comparison, the smaller stipes of Laminaria have a higher modulus of elasticity in tension (Etension = 6–28 {MN·m−2)} and in bending (Ebending = 84–109 {MN·m−2)}, similar strength (σbrk = 1–3 {MN·m−2)}, and a higher torsion modulus (G = 0.7–10 {MN·m−2)}, combined with a lower breaking strain (εbrk = 0.2–0.3) than Durvillaea. Time-dependent, viscoelastic reactions were investigated with cycling tests. The tested species dissipated 42–52\% of the loading energy in tension through plastic-viscoelastic processes, a finding that bears important ecological implications. Overall, there seems to be no correlation between single material properties and the size or habitat position of the tested seaweed species.},

	abstract = {1. The aim of the present experiments was to characterize the central chemical drive of fictive respiration in the isolated {CNS} of the newborn opossum, Monodelphis domestica. This opossum preparation, in contrast to those of neonatal rats and mice, produces respiratory rhythm of high frequency in vitro. 2. Fictive respiration was recorded from C3-C5 ventral roots of the isolated {CNS} of 4- to 14-day-old opossums using suction electrodes. At room temperature (21-23 degrees C) the frequency of respiration was 43 +/- 5.3 min-1 (mean +/- {S.E.M.}, n = 50) in basal medium Eagle's medium ({BMEM)} equilibrated with 5\% {CO2-95\%} O2, {pH} 7.37-7.40. Respiratory discharges remained regular throughout 8 h experiments and continued for more than 20 h in culture. 3. Superfusion of the brainstem confirmed that solutions of {pH} 6.3-7.2 increased both the amplitude and frequency of respiration. High {pH} solutions (7.5-7.7) had the opposite effect and abolished the rhythm at {pH} 7.7. Addition of {ACh} (50-100 {microM)} or carbachol (0.01-10 {microM)} to the brainstem superfusion also increased the amplitude and frequency of respiratory activity, as did physostigmine (50-100 {microM)} or neostigmine (20-50 {microM).} Conversely, scopolamine (50-100 {microM)} reduced the amplitude and frequency of the basal respiratory rhythm by about 30\%. 4. H(+)- and cholinergic-sensitive areas on the surface of the isolated {CNS} were explored with a small micropipette (outer tip diameter, 100 microns) filled with {BMEM} ({pH} 6.5) or 1 {microM} carbachol. Carbachol applied to H(+)- and cholinergic-sensitive areas in the ventral medulla mimicked the changes of respiratory pattern produced by low {pH} application. Responses to altered {pH} and carbachol were abolished by scopolamine (50 {microM).} Histochemistry demonstrated several medullary groups of neurons stained for acetylcholinesterase. The superficial location of one of these groups coincided with a functional and anatomically well-defined {pH-} and carbachol-sensitive area placed medial to the hypoglossal roots. 5. Exploration of chemosensitive areas revealed that application of drugs or solutions of different {pH} to a single well-defined spot could have selective and distinctive effects upon amplitude and frequency of respiratory activity. 6. These results show that fictive respiration in the isolated {CNS} of the newborn opossum is tonically driven by chemical- and cholinergic-sensitive areas located on the ventral medulla, the activity of which regulates frequency and amplitude of respiration. They suggest that a cholinergic relay, although not essential for rhythm generation, is involved in the central {pH} chemosensory mechanism, or that cholinergic and chemical inputs converge upon the same input pathway to the respiratory pattern generator.},

This increase could result from enhanced respiratory-modulated drive arising from the medulla normally gated by vagal activity. We hypothesized that {DL} pontine activity during delayed-I tests would be comparable to that following vagotomy. Ensemble recordings of neuronal activity were obtained before and after vagotomy and during delayed-I tests in decerebrate, paralysed and ventilated cats. In general, changes in activity pattern during the delayed-I tests were similar to those after vagotomy, with the exception of firing-rate differences at the inspiratory–expiratory phase transition. Even activity that was respiratory-modulated with the vagi intact became more modulated while withholding lung inflation and following vagotomy. Furthermore, we recorded activity that was excited by lung inflation as well as changes that persisted past the stimulus cycle. Computer simulations of a recurrent inhibitory neural network model account not only for enhanced respiratory modulation with vagotomy but also the varied activities observed with the vagi intact. We conclude that (a) {DL} pontine neurones receive both vagal-dependent excitatory inputs and central respiratory drive; (b) even though changes in pontine activity are transient, they can persist after no-I tests whether or not changes in the respiratory pattern occur in the subsequent cycles; and (c) models of respiratory control should depict a recurrent inhibitory circuitry, which can act to maintain the stability and provide plasticity to the respiratory pattern.},

Two characteristic features of the control of respiration in the neonatal opossum are evident from such tests. First, changes in rate are achieved by changes in the duration of the expiratory phase of respiration. This result suggests that the timing of the respiratory cycle in the neonatal opossum is controlled by an expiratory instead of an inspiratory “off-switch”. Second, the rate and the amplitude of the respiratory excursions can be controlled independently, depending on the stimulus. For example, an increase in temperature increases the rate of fictive respiration without changing its amplitude, whereas noradrenaline decreases the rate while increasing the amplitude. Thus, changes of timing and amplitude need not go hand in hand. The opossum {CNS} offers a favorable preparation for the analysis of neural mechanisms that generate and modulate a motor rhythm, as the animal develops from embryonic to adult stages.},

The spiration reflex ({AspR)} is characterized by solitary rapid and strong inspiratory effort with a reciprocal inhibition, preventing a subsequent active expiration, while the expiration reflex ({ExpR)} manifests by rapid and strong expiratory effort, starting without a preceding, inspiration, or reciprocal inhibition of occasional spontaneous inspiration. The retro-trapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group neurones described as the distinct generator for active E in rats, are activated also during the {ExpR} in adult cats. Brainstem transection 5 mm above the obex eliminates the E generator and the {ExpR}, but preserves the I generator located in the pre-Bötzinger Complex, and also the {AspR.} This suggests the existence of a distinct I generator in cats as well as rats, and its contribution to the generation of the {AspR.} Persistence of the {AspR} in adult cats during asphyxic gasping, their similar character and the strong activation of I neurones at many places in the medulla and pons, suggest a common brainstem neuronal circuit contributing to generation of both the gasping and the gasp-like {AspR.} That the {AspR} and {ExpR} have distinct multilevel brainstem control mechanisms supports the dual theory of control and provides unique models for testing respiratory rhythm and pattern generation. The {AspR} may be compared with the powerful "auto-resuscitation effects of asphyxic gasping"; the {ExpR} may underly the effectiveness of the laryngeal chemoreflexes in prevention of lung diseases.},

The experimental animals had been acclimated at 12 {°C.} The membrane potential was found to increase with temperature. In the lower temperature range (e.g., between {6°C} and 14–18 {°C)} the slope was usually steeper; the maximal rate of change was 2 {mV/°C.} The amplitude of facilitated slow ejp's (10/s) changes only insignificantly over the temperature span from 6 {°C} to about 22 {°C} and declines at higher temperatures. Fast ejp's have maximal amplitudes at 20 {°C} and decline at lower and higher temperatures, the decline being insignificant, however, below 14 {°C.} Facilitation rate also changes little with temperature; a significant increase occurs near 30 {°C} in the case of fast ejp's, and between 15 {°C} and 20 {°C} in the case of slow ejp's. Above 28 {°C}, facilitation of slow ejp's declines. As the temperature is lowered, many muscles develop a contracture which may reach 10\% of maximal tension at 6 {°C.} These temperature-induced contractures can be abolished by stimulation of the inhibitory axon. The effectiveness of the inhibitory axon in reducing the contraction caused by the slow motor axon increases with decreasing temperature. The time course of the decay of both slow and fast ejp's increases with falling temperature, particularly in the temperature range below 12 {°C.} At a given frequency (1–30/s), both slow and fast contractions increased with falling temperature over the entire temperature range tested. This increased efficiency of the neuro-muscular system is attributed to the depolarization and the prolonged time course of the ejp's.},

	abstract = {Simulations performed with neuromechanical models are providing insight into the neural control of locomotion that would be hard if not impossible to obtain in any other way. We first discuss the known properties of the neural mechanisms controlling locomotion, with a focus on mammalian systems. The rhythm-generating properties of central pattern generators ({CPGs)} are discussed in light of results indicating that cycle characteristics may be preset by tonic drive to spinal interneuronal networks. We then describe neuromechanical simulations that have revealed some basic rules of interaction between {CPGs}, sensory-mediated switching mechanisms and the biomechanics of locomotor movements. We posit that the spinal {CPG} timer and the sensory-mediated switch operate in parallel, the former being driven primarily by descending inputs and the latter by the kinematics. The {CPG} timer produces extensor and flexor phase durations, which covary along specific lines in a plot of phase- versus cycle-duration. We coined the term “phase-duration characteristics” to describe such plots. Descending input from higher centers adjusts the operating points on the phase-duration characteristics according to anticipated biomechanical requirements. In well-predicted movements, {CPG-generated} phase durations closely match those required by the kinematics, minimizing the corrections in phase duration required of the sensory switching mechanism. We propose the term “neuromechanical tuning” to describe this process of matching the {CPG} to the kinematics.},

In this light, it is plausible that stretch channels, membrane proteins whose physiological roles have been elusive, may be transporters exhibiting channel-like properties in response to mechanical stress. We recently described a case, however, where this seems an unlikely explanation. An Aplysia K channel whose physiological pedigree is well established (it is an excitability-modulating conductance mechanism) was found able to be activated by stretch. Here we establish more firmly the identity of this Aplysia conductance, the S-channel, as a stretch channel. We show that the permeation and fast kinetic properties of the stretch-activated channel and of the {FMRFamide-activated} S-channel are indistinguishable. We have also made progress in extending the kinetic analysis of the stretch channel to situations of multiple channel activity.

After a review of the properties of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.},

2. Electrical recordings from wing sensory nerves showed many units which responded to wing movements of various kinds. During flight the sensory discharge was timed to certain phases of the wing-beat cycle.
3. Surgical removal of the sources of timed input did not abolish patterned output, which resembled that during flight, but the frequency of cycling was considerably reduced. Either electrical stimulation of the nerve cord or continuous wind on the head could elicit the pattern.
4. A multiplicity of oscillators in the flight control system was demonstrated.
5. It is suggested that the basic co-ordination of flight is an inherent function of the central nervous system but that peripheral feedback loops influence the frequency of Operation and details of pattern.},

These contractions are in turn directed by motoneurons which emerge from special positions in the spinal cord having a spatial periodicity that matches the segmentation of the backbone. Measurements from these positions (“ventral roots”) show rhythmic voltage changes (bursts of activity) at each such point, with a uniform frequency and a phase lag between any two points that are proportional to the distance between the points; i.e., the neural activity is a constant speed travelling wave. For technical reasons, much of this data has been gathered for dogfish and lamprey [1,2]; some of the observations have been corroborated for other species.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the reduced fatigability of muscles exercised at short length may result from a decrease in the metabolic cost of contractions in the shortened position. We compared the fatigue properties and metabolic cost of stimulated isometric tetanic contractions in the tibialis anterior of 10 normal subjects at the optimum length (Lo) for force production and when the muscle was shortened (Ls). Six 15-s ischemic contractions at Ls caused force to decline to 53\% of the fresh value when tested at Lo, whereas muscles exercised and tested at Lo declined to 40\% of fresh force. However, the extent of fatigue was proportionately greater if the muscle was exercised and tested at Ls. The apparent fatigue resistance of short muscles was found to be a consequence of recovery occurring under ischemic conditions while the muscle was changed from Ls to Lo-. {31P-nuclear} magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed similar metabolic changes associated with 5-s stimulated contractions at Lo and Ls, indicating that any differences in fatigability at the two lengths were not caused by altered metabolic costs. The similarity between the force profiles of muscles fatigued at Ls and those fatigued by high-frequency stimulation supports the hypothesis that an enhanced activation failure occurs at Ls, possibly resulting from failure of sarcolemmal action potential propagation in the transverse tubules.},

Nonetheless, they seldom have a shape that appears streamlined and they are constructed of weak, compliant materials. How do they survive? The answer is complex, but a coherent story is beginning to emerge. The combined effect of frond shape and material properties ensures that algae are flexible. In small individuals, flexibility allows the plant to reorient and reconfigure in flow, thereby assuming a streamlined shape and reducing the applied hydrodynamic force. In large individuals, flexibility allows fronds to `go with the flow', a strategy that can at times allow the plant to avoid hydrodynamic forces but may at other times impose inertial loads. Our understanding of algal mechanics is such that we can begin to predict the survivorship of algae as a function of size, spatial distribution and wave climate.},

	abstract = {1. We explore the roles of conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley ({HH)} models using a method that allows the explicit linking of {HH} model input-output behavior to parameter values for maximal conductances, voltage shifts, and time constants. The procedure can be used to identify not only the parameter values most critical to supporting a neuronal activity pattern of interest but also the relationships between parameters which may be required, e.g., limited ranges of relative magnitudes. 2. The method is the repeated use of stochastic search to find hundreds or even thousands of different sets of model parameter values that allow a {HH} model to produce a desired behavior, such as current-frequency transduction, to within a desired tolerance, e.g., frequency match to within 10 Hz. Graphical or other analysis may then be performed to reveal the shape and boundaries of the parameter solution regions that support the desired behavior. 3. The shape of these parameter regions can reveal parameter values and relationships essential to the behavior. For instance, graphical display may reveal covariances between maximal conductance values, or a much wider range of variation in some maximal conductance values than in others. 4. We demonstrate the use of these techniques with simple, representative {HH} models, primarily that of Connor et al. for crustacean walking leg axons, but also some extensions of the results are explored using the more complex model of {McCormick} and Huguenard for thalamocortical relay neurons. Both models are single compartment. Behaviors studied include current-to-frequency transduction, the time delay to first action potential in response to current steps, and the timing of action potential occurrences in response to both square-wave current injection and the injection of currents derived from in vitro records of excitatory postsynaptic currents. 5. Using these simple models, we find that relatively general behaviors such as current-frequency ({I/F)} curves may be supported by very broad, but bounded parameter solution regions, with the shape of the solution regions revealing the relative importance of the maximal conductances of a model in creating the behavior. Furthermore, we find that a focus on increasingly specific behaviors, such as {I/F} behavior, defined by tolerances of only a few hertz combined with strict requirements for action potential height, inevitably leads to increasingly narrow, and eventually nonphysiologically narrow, regions of acceptable parameter values. 6. We use the Connor et al. model to reproduce the in vitro action potential timing responses of a rat brain stem neuron to various stimuli.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS)}},

The compartmental Wilson-Callaway model for the dopaminergic neuron is an example of a system that exhibits a wide variety of mixed-mode patterns upon variation of a control parameter. One characteristic feature of this system is the presence of multiple time scales. In this article, we study the Wilson-Callaway model from a geometric point of view. We show that the observed mixed-mode dynamics is caused by a slowly varying canard structure. By appropriately transforming the model equations, we reduce them to an underlying three-dimensional canonical form that can be analyzed via a slight adaptation of the approach developed by

	abstract = {Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that when activated can produce rhythmic motor patterns such as walking, breathing, flying, and swimming in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information. General principles of the organization of these circuits and their control by higher brain centers have come from the study of smaller circuits found in invertebrates. Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuro-modulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

Ablation, surgical manipulation or experimental stimulation of different sense organs (femoral chordotonal organ, campaniform sensilla on trochanter and femur basis, proprioceptors at the coxatrochanter joint) were performed, and the resulting changes in motor output were recorded. These experiments demonstrate that the walking- and searching-pattern generators cannot be separated, at least not for the movements investigated. This walking- and searching-pattern generator consists of central modules, each of which produces irregular alternation of the activity of motor neurones of antagonistic muscles of a single joint, and of “reflex loops”. At least some of these reflex loops are only present in the active animal. They are responsible either for the control of a single joint or for the coordination of the movements of separate joints. The performance of these reflexes does not only depend on the state of activity of the animal; some of them additionally seem to depend on the context signalled by other sense organs.},

	abstract = {What are the mechanisms that generate the motor patterns for rhythmic movements in animals? Until recently it has widely been accepted that the relative timing of motor activity is determined by central neuronal circuits termed central pattern generators ({CPGs).} The validity of this view is examined for four motor systems in which there is a high degree of sensory regulation: the walking systems of the cat, cockroach and stick insect, and the flight system of the locust. In none of these systems is the evidence sufficient to conclude that a {CPG} is primarily responsible for establishing the timing of motor activity. In the stick insect there is no evidence for the existence of a {CPG} for walking at all, while in the cockroach the deafferented motor pattern differs from the normal walking pattern to such an extent that phasic afferent input must play an important part in establishing the timing of motor activity. Reflex pathways have been identified which appear to function to produce some aspects of the normal motor pattern for walking in insects. No firm conclusion can be reached regarding the role of central pattern generators in establishing the timing of motor activity in the walking system of the cat because the motor patterns in completely deafferented preparations have not been analysed in sufficient detail to allow an adequate comparison with the intact motor pattern. Finally, in the flight system of the locust it has recently been found that one entire phase of the normal flight cycle depends on phasic afferent input from wing receptors, and that sensory feedback is involved in the generation of rhythmicity. It is now clear that {CPGs} as defined in deafferented preparations do not form the basis for establishing the timing of activity in all rhythmic motor systems. Thus central pattern generation cannot be regarded as universal functional principle for rhythmic motor systems.},

	abstract = {The anterior portion of intrinsic buccal muscle 3 (I3a) is innervated by two motor neurons, B3 and B38, which appear to use glutamate as their fast excitatory transmitter. B3 and B38 express the neuropeptides {FMRFamide} and the small cardioactive peptides ({SCPs)}, respectively. We have shown previously that stimulation of B38 causes release of the {SCPs} from terminals in the muscle. The I3a muscle also receives input from neurons that use {5HT} as a modulatory transmitter. The {SCPs} and {5HT} potently facilitated B38-evoked excitatory junction potentials ({EJPs)} but had only a small effect on B3-evoked {EJPs;} however, both the {SCPs} and {5HT} strongly potentiated contractions evoked by both B3 and B38, indicating that the two substances must also act on excitation–contraction coupling. The selective facilitation of B38-evoked {EJPs}, however, did manifest itself in other parameters. Decreases in the firing frequencies and burst durations that were threshold to evoke contractions and decreases in the latency between the onset of a burst and the onset of the evoked contraction were all much larger for B38 than for B3. Indeed, B38 bursts recorded during feeding-like behavior would be subthreshold for evoking contractions in the absence of this modulation. All of the effects of the {SCPs} reversed during washout, whereas those of {5HT} were persistent, lasting many hours after washout. Thus, the {SCPs} and {5HT} dramatically change the behavioral output of these motor neurons, increasing the amplitude of contractions evoked by both B3 and B38, and shifting the temporal relationship between bursts in B38 and its evoked contractions.},

Presumably regulation of cell division in the earliest ancestors of eukaryotes was a considerably simpler affair. Nasmyth (1995) recently proposed a mechanism for control of a putative, primordial, eukaryotic cell cycle, based on antagonistic interactions between a {cyclin–CDK} and the anaphase promoting complex ({APC)} that labels the cyclin subunit for proteolysis. We recast this idea in mathematical form and show that the model exhibits hysteretic behaviour between alternative steady states: a G1–like state ({APC} on, {CDK} activity low, {DNA} unreplicated and replication complexes assembled) and an {S/M–like} state ({APC} off, {CDK} activity high, {DNA} replicated and replication complexes disassembled). In our model, the transition from G1 to {S/M} ({‘Start’)} is driven by cell growth, and the reverse transition ({‘Finish’)} is driven by completion of {DNA} synthesis and proper alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate. This simple and effective mechanism for coupling growth and division and for accurately copying and partitioning a genome consisting of numerous chromosomes, each with multiple origins of replication, could represent the core of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Furthermore, we show how other controls could be added to this core and speculate on the reasons why stoichiometric inhibitors and {CDK} inhibitory phosphorylation might have been appended to the primitive alternation between cyclin accumulation and degradation.},

3. Many features of this length—tension relation are simply explained on the sliding-filament theory.
4. It is concluded that, in the plateau and at greater lengths, the tension on each thin filament is made up of equal contributions from each bridge which it overlaps on adjacent thick filaments.

Recent studies in cognitive science suggest that emotion and cognition are subserved by different, although heavily integrated, neural systems. Understanding the time-varying relationship of emotion and cognition is a challenging goal with important implications for neuroscience. We formulate here the dynamical model of emotion-cognition interaction that is based on the following principles: (1) the temporal evolution of cognitive and emotion modes are captured by the incoming stimuli and competition within and among themselves (competition principle); (2) metastable states exist in the unified emotion-cognition phase space; and (3) the brain processes information with robust and reproducible transients through the sequence of metastable states. Such a model can take advantage of the often ignored temporal structure of the emotion-cognition interaction to provide a robust and generalizable method for understanding the relationship between brain activation and complex human behavior. The mathematical image of the robust and reproducible transient dynamics is a Stable Heteroclinic Sequence ({SHS)}, and the Stable Heteroclinic Channels ({SHCs).} These have been hypothesized to be possible mechanisms that lead to the sequential transient behavior observed in networks. We investigate the modularity of {SHCs}, i.e., given a {SHS} and a {SHC} that is supported in one part of a network, we study conditions under which the {SHC} pertaining to the cognition will continue to function in the presence of interfering activity with other parts of the network, i.e., emotion.},

In vivo observations demonstrate that Aplysia biting is associated with strong protractions and rapid initial retractions, whereas Aplysia swallowing is associated with weaker protractions and slower initial retractions. During biting, the musculature joining the radula/odontophore to the buccal mass (termed the “hinge”) is stretched more than in swallowing. To test the hypothesis that stretch of the hinge might contribute to rapid retractions observed in biting, we analyzed the hinge’s passive properties. During biting, the hinge is stretched sufficiently to assist retraction. In contrast, during swallowing, the hinge is not stretched sufficiently for its passive forces to assist retraction, because the odontophore’s anterior movement is smaller than during biting. A quantitative model demonstrated that steady-state passive forces were sufficient to generate the retraction movements observed during biting. Experimental measures of the relative magnitude of the hinge’s active and passive forces at the protraction displacements of biting suggest that passive forces are at least a third of the total force.},

	abstract = {How does neural control reflect changes in mechanical advantage and muscle function? In the Aplysia feeding system a protractor muscle’s mechanical advantage decreases as it moves the structure that grasps food (the radula/odontophore) in an anterior direction. In contrast, as the radula/odontophore is moved forward, the jaw musculature’s mechanical advantage shifts so that it may act to assist forward movement of the radula/odontophore instead of pushing it posteriorly. To test whether the jaw musculature’s context-dependent function can compensate for the falling mechanical advantage of the protractor muscle, we created a kinetic model of Aplysia’s feeding apparatus. During biting, the model predicts that the reduction of the force in the protractor muscle I2 will prevent it from overcoming passive forces that resist the large anterior radula/odontophore displacements observed during biting. To produce protractions of the magnitude observed during biting behaviors, the nervous system could increase I2’s contractile strength by neuromodulating I2, or it could recruit the {I1/I3} jaw muscle complex. Driving the kinetic model with in vivo {EMG} and {ENG} predicts that, during biting, early activation of the context-dependent jaw muscle {I1/I3} may assist in moving the radula/odontophore anteriorly during the final phase of protraction. In contrast, during swallowing, later activation of {I1/I3} causes it to act purely as a retractor. Shifting the timing of onset of {I1/I3} activation allows the nervous system to use a mechanical equilibrium point that allows {I1/I3} to act as a protractor rather than an equilibrium point that allows {I1/I3} to act as a retractor. This use of equilibrium points may be similar to that proposed for vertebrate control of movement.},

	abstract = {Bath application of muscarinic agonists induced rhythmic motor activity in an in vitro preparation of the thoracic nervous system of the crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In 70\% of the cases, the rhythm was organized into 1 of the 2 normal patterns: “backward” walking or “forward” walking. In the rest (30\%), the ganglion produced either a series of bursts of impulses or no rhythm at all, just an increase in the tonic activity. When it was isolated from all ascending and descending afferents, the fourth thoracic ganglion was still able to generate rhythmic motor output during bath application of muscarinic agonists. In certain motor neurons, muscarinic agonists induced plateau potentials. Under these conditions, some of these motor neurons were able to change the period of the motor pattern, which might suggest that these motor neurons were part of the central pattern generator ({CPG)} for locomotion. In the presence of 5 x 10(-{6)M} {TTX}, the membrane potential of these motor neurons continued to oscillate with organized rhythmic membrane potential oscillations into 1 of the 2 patterns. Under these conditions, current injection into certain motor neurons demonstrated that they continued to affect the {CPG.} Two classes of walking leg interneurons have been found. First, there are those with a sustained membrane potential: injection of a steady depolarizing current into some of these interneurons induced rhythmic activity in all thoracic motor nerves, even in the absence of any pharmacological activation. Second, there are those with an oscillating membrane potential: these seemed to enable silent motor neurons to be involved in an ongoing rhythm.},

	abstract = {A comparison has been made of the patterns of muscle activity during swimming in the intact and spinal lamprey, and the patterns of ventral root activity in the in vitro preparation of the lamprey spinal cord. Electromyographic (e.m.g.) activity was recorded with intramuscular bipolar electrodes from three segmental levels in intact lampreys swimming in a swim-mill at a range of swimming speeds. The patterns of activity obtained were similar to those seen in elasmobranch and teleost fish. After high spinal transection, lampreys could be induced to swim continuously for a period of several minutes in the swim-mill by a light initial mechanical stimulation of the tail or dorsal fin. The patterns of e.m.g. activity obtained from spinal animals at a range of swimming speeds were similar to those obtained in the intact state. Portions of spinal cord were isolated encompassing those segments from which e.m.g. recordings had been made and ventral root recordings were made in vitro of the rhythmic activity induced by bath application of D-glutamate. In all experiments the mean duration of the bursts of activity at any segmental level was directly proportional to the mean cycle duration, and the constant of proportionality (about 0.36) was similar for all three types of preparation. In all preparations the mean time delay for the activation of segments in the rostral-caudal direction was proportional to the cycle duration and to the number of segments between recording positions. The proportionality constant, or phase lag per segment, was approximately equal to 0.01 in all three types of preparation.},

	abstract = {Nitric oxide ({NO)} regulates Aplysia feeding by novel mechanisms, suggesting new roles for {NO} in controlling the behavior of higher animals. In Aplysia, (1) {NO} helps maintain arousal when produced by neurons responding to attempts to swallow food; (2) {NO} biases the motor system to reject and reposition food that resists swallowing; (3) if mechanically resistant food is not successfully swallowed, {NO} mediates the formation and expression of memories of food inedibility; (4) {NO} production at rest inhibits feeding, countering the effects of food stimuli exciting feeding. At a cellular level, {NO-dependent} channels contribute to the resting potential of neurons controlling food finding and food consumption. Increases in l-arginine after animals eat act as a post-feeding inhibitory signal, presumably by modulating {NO} production at rest. {NO} also signals non-feeding behaviors that are associated with feeding inhibition. Thus, depending on context, {NO} may enhance or inhibit feeding behavior. The different functions of {NO} may reflect the evolution of {NO} signaling from a response to tissue damage that was then elaborated and used for additional functions. These results suggest that in higher animals (1) elicited and background transmitter release may have similar effects; (2) {NO} may be produced by neurons without firing, influencing adjacent neurons; (3) background {NO} production may contribute to a neuron's resting potential; (4) circulating factors affecting background {NO} production may regulate spatially separated neurons; (5) l-arginine can be used to regulate neural activity; (6) l-arginine may be an effective post-ingestion metabolic signal to regulate feeding.},

	abstract = {Whereas major insights into the neuronal basis of adaptive behavior have been gained from the study of automatic behaviors, including reflexive and rhythmic motor acts, the neural substrates for goal-directed behaviors in which decision-making about action selection and initiation are crucial, remain poorly understood. However, the mollusk Aplysia is proving to be increasingly relevant to redressing this issue. The functional properties of the central circuits that govern this animal’s goal-directed feeding behavior and particularly the neural processes underlying the selection and initiation of specific feeding actions are becoming understood. In addition to relying on the intrinsic operation of central networks, goal-directed behaviors depend on external sensory inputs that through associative learning are able to shape decision-making strategies. Here, we will review recent findings on the functional design of the central network that generates Aplysia’s feeding-related movements and the sensory-derived plasticity that through learning can modify the selection and initiation of appropriate action. The animal’s feeding behavior and the implications of decision-making will be briefly described. The functional design of the underlying buccal network will then be used to illustrate how cellular diversity and the coordination of neuronal burst activity provide substrates for decision-making. The contribution of specific synaptic and neuronal membrane properties within the buccal circuit will also be discussed in terms of their role in motor pattern selection and initiation. The ability of learning to “rigidify” these synaptic and cellular properties so as to regularize network operation and lead to the expression of stereotyped rhythmic behavior will then be described. Finally, these aspects will be drawn into a conceptual framework of how Aplysia’s goal-directed circuitry compares to the central pattern generating networks for invertebrate rhythmic behaviors.},
