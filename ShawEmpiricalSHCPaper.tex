\begin{abstract}
Many behaviors require reliably generating sequences of motor activity while
adapting the activity to incoming sensory information.  This process has often
been conceptually explained as either fully dependent on sensory input (a
chain reflex) or fully independent of sensory input (an idealized central
pattern generator, or CPG), although the consensus of the field is that most neural
pattern generators lie somewhere between these two extremes.  Many mathematical
models of neural pattern generators use limit cycles to generate the sequence
of behavior, but other models, such as a heteroclinic channel (an attracting
chain of saddle points), have been
suggested.  To explore the continuum between CPGs and chain reflexes, in this
paper we describe a nominal model of feeding in
\textit{Aplysia californica} that can be smoothly shifted between a
generic limit cycle (where the velocity changes by less than an order of
magnitude throughout the cycle) and a heteroclinic channel (where the velocity
becomes small when the trajectory passes near saddle points).  We then study
the behavior of the system in these two parameter regimes and compare the
behavior of the models with behavior recorded in the animal \textit{in vivo}
and \textit{in vitro}.  We show that while both pattern generators can generate
similar behavior, the stable heteroclinic channel can better respond to
small changes in sensory input induced by load, and that the response matches
the changes seen when a load is added \textit{in vivo}.  We then show that
the stable heteroclinic channel shows much more dramatic slowing of activity
than the generic limit cycle when sensory input is reduced, and show that
similar slowing with removal of proprioception is seen \textit{in vitro}.
Finally, we show that the distributions of burst lengths seen \textit{in
vivo} are better matched by the distribution expected from a stable
heteroclinic channel than that expected from a generic limit cycle.
These observations suggest that feeding behavior in \textit{Aplysia} may be
better described by a model using a heteroclinic channel than a more generic
limit cycle.
