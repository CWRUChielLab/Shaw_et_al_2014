	Abstract = {Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) encode afferent information in the rate and temporal structure of their spike trains. Both spontaneous firing in these neurons and its modulation by synaptic inputs depend on Ca(2+) current carried by Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q) type channels. Previous studies have described how loss-of-function Ca(v)2.1 mutations affect intrinsic excitability and excitatory transmission in PCs. This study examines the effects of the leaner mutation on fast GABAergic transmission and its modulation of spontaneous firing in PCs. The leaner mutation enhances spontaneous synaptic inhibition of PCs, leading to transitory reductions in PC firing rate and increased spike rate variability. Enhanced inhibition is paralleled by an increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) measured under voltage clamp. These differences are abolished by tetrodotoxin, implicating effects of the mutation on spike-induced GABA release. Elevated sIPSC frequency in leaner PCs is not accompanied by increased mean firing rate in molecular layer interneurons, but IPSCs evoked in PCs by direct stimulation of these neurons exhibit larger amplitude, slower decay rate, and a higher burst probability compared to wild-type PCs. Ca(2+) release from internal stores appears to be required for enhanced inhibition since differences in sIPSC frequency and amplitude in leaner and wild-type PCs are abolished by thapsigargin, an ER Ca(2+) pump inhibitor. These findings represent the first account of the functional consequences of a loss-of-function P/Q channel mutation on PC firing properties through altered GABAergic transmission. Gain in synaptic inhibition shown here would compromise the fidelity of information coding in these neurons and may contribute to impaired cerebellar function resulting from loss-of function mutations in the Ca(V)2.1 channel gene.},

	Abstract = {The leaner mouse mutation of the Cacna1a gene leads to a reduction in P-type Ca2+ current, the dominant Ca2+ current in Purkinje cells (PCs). Here, we compare the electro-responsiveness and structure of PCs from age-matched leaner and wild-type (WT) mice in pharmacological isolation from synaptic inputs in cerebellar slices. We report that compared with WT, leaner PCs exhibit lower current threshold for Na+ spike firing, larger subthreshold membrane depolarization, rapid adaptation followed by complete block of Na+ spikes upon strong depolarization, and fail to generate Ca2+-Na+ spike bursts. The Na+ spike waveforms in leaner PCs have slower kinetics, reduced spike amplitude and afterhyperpolarization. We show that a deficit in the P-type Ca2+ current caused by the leaner mutation accounts for most but not all of the changes in mutant PC electro-responsiveness. The selective P-type Ca2+ channel blocker, omega-agatoxin-IVA, eliminated differences in subthreshold membrane depolarization, adaptation of Na+ spikes upon strong current-pulse stimuli, Na+ spike waveforms and Ca2+-Na+ burst activity. In contrast, a lower current threshold for eliciting repetitive Na+ spikes in leaner PCs was still observed after blockade of the P-type Ca2+ current, suggesting secondary effects of the mutation that render PCs hyper-excitable. Higher input resistance, reduced whole-cell capacitance and smaller dendritic size accompanied the enhanced excitability in leaner PCs, indicative of developmental retardation in these cells caused by P/Q-type Ca2+ channel malfunction. Our data indicate that a deficit in P-type Ca2+ current leads to complex functional and structural changes in PCs, impairing their intrinsic and integrative properties.},

@article{Sigworth1980JPhysiol,
	Abstract = {1. Single myelinated nerve fibres 12-17 mum in diameter from Rana temporaria and Rana pipiens were voltage clamped at 2-5 degrees C. Potassium currents were blocked by internal Cs(+) and external tetraethylammonium ion. Series resistance compensation was employed.2. Sets of 80-512 identical, 20 ms depolarizations were applied, with the pulses repeated at intervals of 300-600 ms. The resulting membrane current records, filtered at 5 kHz, showed record-to-record variations of the current on the order of 1%. From each set of records the time course of the mean current and the time course of the variance were calculated.3. The variance was assumed to arise primarily from two independent sources of current fluctuations: the stochastic gating of sodium channels and the thermal noise background in the voltage clamp. Measurement of the passive properties of the nerve preparation allowed the thermal noise variance to be estimated, and these estimates accounted for the variance observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin and at the reversal potential.4. After the variance sigma(2) was corrected for the contribution from the background, its relationship to the mean current I could be fitted by the function sigma(2) = iI-I(2)/N expected for N independent channels having one non-zero conductance level. The single channel currents i corresponded to a single-channel chord conductance gamma = 6.4 +/- 0.9 pS (S.D.; n = 14). No significant difference in gamma was observed between the two species of frogs. The size of the total population of channels ranged from 20,000 to 46,000.5. The voltage dependence of i corresponded closely to the form of the instantaneous current-voltage relationship of the sodium conductance, except at the smallest depolarizations. The small values of i at small depolarizations may have resulted from the filtering of high-frequency components of the fluctuations.6. It is concluded that sodium channels have only two primary levels of conductance, corresponding to ;open' and ;closed' states of the channel.7. The fraction p(max) of channels open at the time of the peak conductance was found to be 0.59 +/- 0.08 (S.D.; n = 5) and 0.9 +/- 0.1 (S.D.; n = 3) for depolarizations to -5 and +125 mV, respectively. (50 ms hyperpolarizations to -105 mV preceded the depolarizations in each case.) These values are similar to those predicted by Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics.8. Fluctuations in the firing threshold of neurones are expected from the stochastic gating of sodium channels. A prediction of the size of these fluctuations based on the measured properties of the channels gives a value of about 1% for the relative spread, which agrees with experimental values in the literature.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal networks produce reliable functional output throughout the lifespan of an animal despite ceaseless molecular turnover and a constantly changing environment. Central pattern generators, such as those of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), are able to robustly maintain their functionality over a wide range of burst periods. Previous experimental work involving extracellular recordings of the pyloric pattern of the STG has demonstrated that as the burst period varies, the inter-neuronal delays are altered proportionally, resulting in burst phases that are roughly invariant. The question whether spike delays within bursts are also proportional to pyloric period has not been explored in detail. The mechanism by which the pyloric neurons accomplish phase maintenance is currently not obvious. Previous studies suggest that the co-regulation of certain ion channel properties may play a role in governing neuronal activity. Here, we observed in long-term recordings of the pyloric rhythm that spike delays can vary proportionally with burst period, so that spike phase is maintained. We then used a conductance-based model neuron to determine whether co-varying ionic membrane conductances results in neural output that emulates the experimentally observed phenomenon of spike phase maintenance. Next, we utilized a model neuron database to determine whether conductance correlations exist in model neuron populations with highly maintained spike phases. We found that co-varying certain conductances, including the sodium and transient calcium conductance pair, causes the model neuron to maintain a specific spike phase pattern. Results indicate a possible relationship between conductance co-regulation and phase maintenance in STG neurons.},

@article{Hudson:2010vn,
	Abstract = {Recent experimental evidence suggests that coordinated expression of ion channels plays a role in constraining neuronal electrical activity. In particular, each neuronal cell type of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion exhibits a unique set of positive linear correlations between ionic membrane conductances. These data suggest a causal relationship between expressed conductance correlations and features of cellular identity, namely electrical activity type. To test this idea, we used an existing database of conductance-based model neurons. We partitioned this database based on various measures of intrinsic activity, to approximate distinctions between biological cell types. We then tested individual conductance pairs for linear dependence to identify correlations. Contrary to experimental evidence, in which all conductance correlations are positive, 32% of correlations seen in this database were negative relationships. In addition, 80% of correlations seen here involved at least one calcium conductance, which have been difficult to measure experimentally. Similar to experimental results, each activity type investigated had a unique combination of correlated conductances. Finally, we found that populations of models that conform to a specific conductance correlation have a higher likelihood of exhibiting a particular feature of electrical activity. We conclude that regulating conductance ratios can support proper electrical activity of a wide range of cell types, particularly when the identity of the cell is well-defined by one or two features of its activity. Furthermore, we predict that previously unseen negative correlations and correlations involving calcium conductances are biologically plausible.},

@article{PrinzBillimoriaMarder2003JNP,
	Abstract = {Conventionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

@article{PaceMackayFeldmanDelNegro2007JPhysiol,
	Abstract = {Breathing movements in mammals depend on respiratory neurons in the preB{\"o}tzinger Complex (preB{\"o}tC), which comprise a rhythmic network and generate robust bursts that form the basis for inspiration. Persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)) is widespread in the preB{\"o}tC and is hypothesized to play a critical role in rhythm generation because of its subthreshold activation and slow inactivation properties that putatively promote long-lasting burst depolarizations. In neonatal mouse slice preparations that retain the preB{\"o}tC and generate a respiratory-related rhythm, we tested the role of I(NaP) with multiple Na(+) channel antagonists: tetrodotoxin (TTX; 20 nM), riluzole (RIL; 10 microM), and the intracellular Na(+) channel antagonist QX-314 (2 mM). Here we show that I(NaP) promotes intraburst spiking in preB{\"o}tC neurons but surprisingly does not contribute to the depolarization that underlies inspiratory bursts, i.e. the inspiratory drive potential. Local microinjection in the preB{\"o}tC of 10 microM RIL or 20 nM TTX does not perturb respiratory frequency, even in the presence of bath-applied 100 microM flufenamic acid (FFA), which attenuates a Ca(2+)-activated non-specific cation current (I(CAN)) that may also have burst-generating functionality. These data contradict the hypothesis that I(NaP) in preB{\"o}tC neurons is obligatory for rhythmogenesis. However, in the presence of FFA, local microinjection of 10 microM RIL in the raphe obscurus causes rhythm cessation, which suggests that I(NaP) regulates the excitability of neurons outside the preB{\"o}tC, including serotonergic raphe neurons that project to, and help maintain, rhythmic preB{\"o}tC function.},

	Abstract = {1. In whole cell recordings from layer V neurons in slices of mouse somatosensory neocortex, tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive persistent Na+ current (INaP) was studied by blocking K+ currents with intracellular Cs+ and Ca2+ currents with extracellular Cd2+. During slow voltage ramps, INaP began to activate at around -60 mV, and attained a peak at around -25 mV. The peak amplitude of INaP varied widely from cell to cell (range 60-3,160 pA; median 308 pA, n = 77). At potentials more positive than -35 mV, INaP in all cells was superimposed on a large, TTX-resistant outward current. 2. In hybrid clamp experiments, INaP was significantly reduced by a preceding high-frequency train of spikes. 3. INaP underwent pronounced slow inactivation, which was revealed by systematically varying the ramp speed between 233 and 2.33 mV/s, or varying the duration of a depolarizing prepulse between 0.1 and 10 s. 4. Onset of slow inactivation at +20 mV was monoexponential with tau = 2.06 s (n = 17 cells). Recovery from slow inactivation was voltage dependent. It followed a monoexponential time course with tau = 2.31 s (n = 6) at -70 mV and tau = 1.10 s (n = 4) at -90 mV. These values are not significantly different than values previously reported for slow inactivation of fast-inactivating INa. 5. Slow inactivation of neocortical INaP will influence all neuronal functions in which this current plays a role, including spike threshold determination, synaptic integration, and active propagation in dendrites. The kinetics of slow inactivation suggest that it may be a factor not only during extremely intense spiking, but also during periods of "spontaneous" activity.},

	Abstract = {A kinematic model of the buccal mass of Aplysia californica during swallowing has been developed that incorporates the kinematics of the odontophore, the muscular structure that underlies the pincer-like grasping structure, the radula. The model is based on real-time magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the mid-sagittal cross section of the buccal mass during swallowing. Using kinematic relationships derived from isolated odontophores induced to perform feeding-like movements, the model generates predictions about movement of the buccal mass in the medio-lateral dimension during the feeding cycle that are well-matched to corresponding coronal MRIs of the buccal mass during swallowing. The model successfully reproduces changes in the lengths of the intrinsic (I) buccal muscles I2 and I3 measured experimentally. The model predicts changes in the length of the radular opener muscle I7 throughout the swallowing cycle, generates hypotheses about the muscular basis of radular opening prior to the onset of forward rotation during swallowing and suggests possible context-dependent functions for the I7 muscle, the radular stalk and the I5 (ARC) muscle during radular opening and closing.},

	Abstract = {What are the mechanisms of multifunctionality, i.e. the use of the same peripheral structures for multiple behaviors? We studied this question using the multifunctional feeding apparatus of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, in which the same muscles mediate biting (an attempt to grasp food) and swallowing (ingestion of food). Biting and swallowing responses were compared using magnetic resonance imaging of intact, behaving animals and a three-dimensional kinematic model. Biting is associated with larger amplitude protractions of the grasper (radula/odontophore) than swallowing, and smaller retractions. Larger biting protractions than in swallowing appear to be due to a more anterior position of the grasper as the behavior begins, a larger amplitude contraction of protractor muscle I2, and contraction of the posterior portion of the I1/I3/jaw complex. The posterior I1/I3/jaw complex may be context-dependent, i.e. its mechanical context changes the direction of the force it exerts. Thus, the posterior of I1/I3 may aid protraction near the peak of biting, whereas the entire I1/I3/jaw complex acts as a retractor during swallowing. In addition, larger amplitude closure of the grasper during swallowing allows an animal to exert more force as it ingests food. These results demonstrate that differential deployment of the periphery can mediate multifunctionality.},

	Abstract = {The degrees of freedom problem is often posed by asking which of the many possible degrees of freedom does the nervous system control? By implication, other degrees of freedom are not controlled. We give an operational meaning to "controlled" and "uncontrolled" and describe a method of analysis through which hypotheses about controlled and uncontrolled degrees of freedom can be tested. In this conception, control refers to stabilization, so that lack of control implies reduced stability. The method was used to analyze an experiment on the sit-to-stand transition. By testing different hypotheses about the controlled variables, we systematically approximated the structure of control in joint space. We found that, for the task of sit-to-stand, the position of the center of mass in the sagittal plane was controlled. The horizontal head position and the position of the hand were controlled less stably, while vertical head position appears to be no more controlled than joint motions.},

	Abstract = {The article offers a way to unite three recent developments in the field of motor control and coordination: (1) The notion of synergies is introduced based on the principle of motor abundance; (2) The uncontrolled manifold hypothesis is described as offering a computational framework to identify and quantify synergies; and (3) The equilibrium-point hypothesis is described for a single muscle, single joint, and multijoint systems. Merging these concepts into a single coherent scheme requires focusing on control variables rather than performance variables. The principle of minimal final action is formulated as the guiding principle within the referent configuration hypothesis. Motor actions are associated with setting two types of variables by a controller, those that ultimately define average performance patterns and those that define associated synergies. Predictions of the suggested scheme are reviewed, such as the phenomenon of anticipatory synergy adjustments, quick actions without changes in synergies, atypical synergies, and changes in synergies with practice. A few models are briefly reviewed.},

@article{ParkZatsiorskyLatash2010ExpBrainRes,
	Abstract = {Two approaches to motor redundancy, optimization and the principle of abundance, seem incompatible. The former predicts a single, optimal solution for each task, while the latter assumes that families of equivalent solutions are used. We explored the two approaches using a four-finger pressing task with the requirement to produce certain combination of total normal force and a linear combination of normal forces that approximated the total moment of force in static conditions. In the first set of trials, many force-moment combinations were used. Principal component (PC) analysis showed that over 90% of finger force variance was accounted for by the first two PCs. The analytical inverse optimization (ANIO) approach was applied to these data resulting in quadratic cost functions with linear terms. Optimal solutions formed a hyperplane ("optimal plane") in the four-dimensional finger force space. In the second set of trials, only four force-moment combinations were used with multiple repetitions. Finger force variance within each force-moment combination in the second set was analyzed within the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis. Most finger force variance was confined to a hyperplane (the UCM) compatible with the required force-moment values. We conclude that there is no absolute optimal behavior, and the ANIO yields the best fit to a family of optimal solutions that differ across trials. The difference in the force-producing capabilities of the fingers and in their moment arms may lead to deviations of the "optimal plane" from the subspace orthogonal to the UCM. We suggest that the ANIO and UCM approaches may be complementary in the analysis of motor variability in redundant systems.},

@article{FreitasScholzLatash2010JNsciMeth,
	Abstract = {This article investigates two methodological issues resulting from a recent study of center of mass positional stability during performance of whole-body targeting tasks (Freitas et al., 2006): (1) Can identical results be obtained with uncontrolled manifold (UCM) variance analysis when it is based on estimating the Jacobian using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis compared to that using typical analytic formal geometric model? (2) Are kinematic synergies more related to stabilization of the instantaneous anterior-posterior position of the center of mass (COM(AP)) or the center of pressure (COP(AP))? UCM analysis was used to partition the variance of the joint configuration into 'bad' variance, leading to COM(AP) or COP(AP) variability, and 'good' variance, reflecting the use of motor abundance. Findings indicated (1) nearly identical UCM results for both methods of Jacobian estimation; and (2) more 'good' and less 'bad' joint variance related to stability of COP(AP) than to COM(AP) position. The first result requires further investigation with more degrees of freedom, but suggests that when a formal geometric model is unavailable or overly complex, UCM analysis may be possible by estimating the Jacobian using MLR. Correct interpretation of the second result requires analysis of the singular values of the Jacobian for different performance variables, which indicates how certain amount of joint variance affects each performance variable. Thus, caution is required when interpreting differences in joint variance structure among various performance variables obtained by UCM analysis without first investigating how the different relationships captured by the Jacobian translate those variances into performance-level variance.},

@article{LatashScholzDanionSchoener2001ExpBrainRes,
	Abstract = {The framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM hypothesis) was applied to the analysis of the structure of finger force variability during oscillatory force production tasks. Subjects produced cycles of force with one, two (index and middle), or three (index, middle, and ring) fingers acting in parallel against force sensors mounted inside a small frame. The frame could be placed on the top of a table (stable conditions) or on a 4-mm-wide supporting surface (unstable conditions). Subjects were less variable when they used two fingers than when using one finger; adding the third finger did not change indices of variability of the performance. Components of finger force variance that did (VUN) or did not (VCOMP) change the value of a particular functional variable were computed for two control hypotheses: (1) at each time, the subjects tried to stabilize the total value of force (force-control); and (2), at each time, the subjects tried to stabilize the total moment produced with respect to an axis parallel to the hand/forearm (moment-control). Most subjects showed selective stabilization of moment and destabilization of force throughout most of the force cycle, in both stable and unstable conditions. The shapes of VUN and VCOMP suggested a possibility of selective compensation of timing errors across fingers within force cycles. One subject showed different relations between VUN and VCOMP, suggesting that these relations did in fact reflect particular central strategies of solving the tasks. The UCM method is applicable to force production tasks. It allows the comparison of control hypotheses in a quantitative way and unveils central strategies of control of redundant motor systems. Within this approach, redundancy (rather, abundance) is not a problem but an inherent part of a solution for natural motor tasks.},

@article{SkaggsMcNaughtonWilsonBarnes:1996:Hippocampus,
	Abstract = {O'Keefe and Recce [1993] Hippocampus 3:317-330 described an interaction between the hippocampal theta rhythm and the spatial firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus: they found that a cell's spike activity advances to earlier phases of the theta cycle as the rat passes through the cell's place field. The present study makes use of large-scale parallel recordings to clarify and extend this finding in several ways: 1) Most CA1 pyramidal cells show maximal activity at the same phase of the theta cycle. Although individual units exhibit deeper modulation, the depth of modulation of CA1 population activity is about 50%. The peak firing of inhibitory interneurons in CA1 occurs about 60 degrees in advance of the peak firing of pyramidal cells, but different interneurons vary widely in their peak phases. 2) The first spikes, as the rat enters a pyramidal cell's place field, come 90 degrees-120 degrees after the phase of maximal pyramidal cell population activity, near the phase where inhibition is least. 3) The phase advance is typically an accelerating, rather than linear, function of position within the place field. 4) These phenomena occur both on linear tracks and in two-dimensional environments where locomotion is not constrained to specific paths. 5) In two-dimensional environments, place-related firing is more spatially specific during the early part of the theta cycle than during the late part. This is also true, to a lesser extent, on a linear track. Thus, spatial selectivity waxes and wanes over the theta cycle. 6) Granule cells of the fascia dentata are also modulated by theta. The depth of modulation for the granule cell population approaches 100%, and the peak activity of the granule cell population comes about 90 degrees earlier in the theta cycle than the peak firing of CA1 pyramidal cells. 7) Granule cells, like pyramidal cells, show robust phase precession. 8) Cross-correlation analysis shows that portions of the temporal sequence of CA1 pyramidal cell place fields are replicated repeatedly within individual theta cycles, in highly compressed form. The compression ratio can be as much as 10:1. These findings indicate that phase precession is a very robust effect, distributed across the entire hippocampal population, and that it is likely to be inherited from the fascia dentata or an earlier stage in the hippocampal circuit, rather than generated intrinsically within CA1. It is hypothesized that the compression of temporal sequences of place fields within individual theta cycles permits the use of long-term potentiation for learning of sequential structure, thereby giving a temporal dimension to hippocampal memory traces.},

@article{ErtekinAydogdu:2003:ClinNeurophys,
	Abstract = {Swallowing is a complex motor event that is difficult to investigate in man by neurophysiological experiments. For this reason, the characteristics of the brain stem pathways have been studied in experimental animals. However, the sequential and orderly activation of the swallowing muscles with the monitoring of the laryngeal excursion can be recorded during deglutition. Although influenced by the sensory and cortical inputs, the sequential muscle activation does not alter from the perioral muscles caudally to the cricopharyngeal sphincter muscle. This is one evidence for the existence of the central pattern generator for human swallowing. The brain stem swallowing network includes the nucleus tractus solitarius and nucleus ambiguus with the reticular formation linking synaptically to cranial motoneuron pools bilaterally. Under normal function, the brain stem swallowing network receives descending inputs from the cerebral cortex. The cortex may trigger deglutition and modulate the brain stem sequential activity. The voluntarily initiated pharyngeal swallow involves several cortical and subcortical pathways. The interactions of regions above the brain stem and the brain stem swallowing network is, at present, not fully understood, particularly in humans. Functional neuroimaging methods were recently introduced into the human swallowing research. It has been shown that volitional swallowing is represented in the multiple cortical regions bilaterally but asymmetrically. Cortical organisation of swallowing can be continuously changed by the continual modulatory ascending sensory input with descending motor output. Significance: Dysphagia is a severe symptom complex that can be life threatening in a considerable number of patients. Three-fourths of oropharyngeal dysphagia is caused by neurological diseases. Thus, the responsibility of the clinical neurologist and neurophysiologist in the care for the dysphagic patients is twofold. First, we should be more acquainted with the physiology of swallowing and its disorders, in order to care for the dysphagic patients successfully. Second, we need to evaluate the dysphagic problems objectively using practical electromyography methods for the patients' management. Cortical and subcortical functional imaging studies are also important to accumulate more data in order to get more information and in turn to develop new and effective treatment strategies for dysphagic patients.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism by which chronic, high frequency, electrical deep brain stimulation (HF-DBS) suppresses tremor in Parkinson's disease is unknown. Rest tremor in subjects with Parkinson's disease receiving HF-DBS was recorded continuously throughout switching the deep brain stimulator on (at an effective frequency) and off. These data suggest that the stimulation induces a qualitative change in the dynamics, called a Hopf bifurcation, so that the stable oscillations are destabilized. We hypothesize that the periodic stimulation modifies a parameter affecting the oscillation in a time dependent way and thereby induces a Hopf bifurcation. We explore this hypothesis using a schematic network model of an oscillator interacting with periodic stimulation. The mechanism of time-dependent change of a control parameter in the model captures two aspects of the dynamics observed in the data: (1) a gradual increase in tremor amplitude when the stimulation is switched off and a gradual decrease in tremor amplitude when the stimulation is switched on and (2) a time delay in the onset and offset of the oscillations. This mechanism is consistent with these rest tremor transition data and with the idea that HF-DBS acts via the gradual change of a network property. (c) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of intrinsic neuronal firing dynamics is a critical first step to establishing an accurate biophysical model of any neuron. In this study we examined cerebellar Purkinje cells to determine the bifurcations likely to underlie firing dynamics within a biophysically realistic and experimentally supported model. We show that Purkinje cell dynamics are consistent with a system undergoing a saddle-node bifurcation of fixed points in the transition from rest to firing and a saddle homoclinic bifurcation from firing to rest. Our analyses account for numerous observed Purkinje cell firing properties that include bistability, plateau potentials, specific aspects of the frequency-current (F-I) relationship, first spike latency, and the ability for climbing fiber input to induce state transitions in the bistable regime. We also experimentally confirm new properties predicted from our model and analysis that include the presence of a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP), the ability to fire at low frequencies (<50 Hz) and with a high gain in the F-I relationship, and a bistable region limited to low-frequency firing. Purkinje cell dynamics, including bistability, prove to arise from numerous biophysical factors that include the DAP, fast refractory dynamics, and a long membrane time constant. A hyperpolarizing activated cation current (I(H)) is shown not to be directly involved in establishing bistable dynamics but rather reduces the range for bistability. A combined electrophysiological and modeling approach thus accounts for several properties of Purkinje cells, providing a firm basis from which to assess Purkinje cell output patterns.},

Dendrites of Purkinje cells express a high density of P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels and fire dendritic calcium spikes. Here we show that dendritic subthreshold Kv1.2 subunit-containing Kv1 potassium channels prevent generation of random spontaneous calcium spikes. With Kv1 channels blocked, dendritic calcium spikes drive bursts of somatic sodium spikes and prevent the cell from faithfully encoding motor timing signals. The selective dendritic function of Kv1 channels in Purkinje cells allows them to effectively suppress dendritic hyperexcitability without hindering the generation of somatic action potentials. Further, we show that Kv1 channels also contribute to dendritic integration of parallel fibre synaptic input. Kv1 channels are often targeted to soma and axon and the data presented support a major dendritic function for these channels.},

	Abstract = {Episodic ataxia type-2 (EA2) is caused by mutations in P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels that are expressed at high densities in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Because P/Q channels support neurotransmitter release at many synapses, it is believed that ataxia is caused by impaired synaptic transmission. Here we show that in ataxic P/Q channel mutant mice, the precision of Purkinje cell pacemaking is lost such that there is a significant degradation of the synaptic information encoded in their activity. The irregular pacemaking is caused by reduced activation of calcium-activated potassium (K(Ca)) channels and was reversed by pharmacologically increasing their activity with 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (EBIO). Moreover, chronic in vivo perfusion of EBIO into the cerebellum of ataxic mice significantly improved motor performance. Our data support the hypothesis that the precision of intrinsic pacemaking in Purkinje cells is essential for motor coordination and suggest that K(Ca) channels may constitute a potential therapeutic target in EA2.},

	Abstract = {The orchestration of simple motor tasks by the cerebellum results in coordinated movement and the maintenance of balance. The cerebellum integrates sensory and cortical information to generate the signals required for the coordinated execution of simple motor tasks. These signals originate in the firing rate of Purkinje cells, each of which integrates sensory and cortical information conveyed by granule cell synaptic inputs. Given the importance of the granule cell input-Purkinje cell output function for cerebellar computation, this algorithm was determined. Using several stimulation paradigms, including those that mimicked patterns of granule cell activity similar to those observed in vivo, we quantified the poststimulus maximum firing rate and number of extra spikes in response to granule cell synaptic input. Both of these parameters linearly encoded the strength of synaptic input when inhibitory synaptic transmission was blocked. This linear algorithm was independent of the location or temporal pattern of synaptic input. With inhibitory synaptic transmission intact, the maximum firing rate, but not the number of extra spikes, encoded the strength of granule cell synaptic input. Furthermore, the maximum firing rate of Purkinje cells linearly encoded the strength of synaptic input whether or not the activation of granule cells resulted in a pause in Purkinje cell firing. On the basis of the data presented, we propose that Purkinje cells encode the strength of granule cell synaptic input in their maximum firing rate with a linear algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Purkinje cells can encode the strength of parallel fiber inputs in their firing by using 2 fundamentally different mechanisms, either as pauses or as linear increases in firing rate. It is not clear which of these 2 encoding mechanisms is used by the cerebellum. We used the pattern-recognition capacity of Purkinje cells based on the Marr-Albus-Ito theory of cerebellar learning to evaluate the suitability of the linear algorithm for cerebellar information processing. Here, we demonstrate the simplicity and versatility of pattern recognition in Purkinje cells linearly encoding the strength of parallel fiber inputs in their firing rate. In contrast to encoding patterns with pauses, Purkinje cells using the linear algorithm could recognize a large number of both synchronous and asynchronous input patterns in the presence or absence of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Under all conditions, the number of patterns recognized by Purkinje cells using the linear algorithm was greater than that achieved by encoding information in pauses. Linear encoding of information also allows neurons of deep cerebellar nuclei to use a simple averaging mechanism to significantly increase the computational capacity of the cerebellum. We propose that the virtues of the linear encoding mechanism make it well suited for cerebellar computation.},

	Abstract = {At the center of the computational cerebellar circuitry are Purkinje cells, which integrate synaptic inputs from >150,000 granule cell inputs. Traditional theories of cerebellar function assume that all granule cell inputs are comparable. However, it has recently been suggested that the two anatomically distinct granule cell inputs, ascending and parallel fiber, have different functional roles. By systematically examining the efficacy of patches of granule cells with photostimulation, we found no differences in the efficacy of the two inputs in driving the activity of, or in producing postsynaptic currents in, Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices in vitro. We also found that the activity of Purkinje cells was significantly increased upon stimulation of lateral granule cells in vivo. Moreover, when we estimated parallel fiber and ascending apparent unitary EPSC amplitudes using photostimulation in cerebellar slices in vitro, we found them to be indistinguishable. These results are inconsistent with differential functional roles for these two inputs. Instead, our data support theories of cerebellar computation that consider granule cell inputs to be functionally comparable.},

	Abstract = {Blocking the small-conductance (SK) calcium-activated potassium channel promotes burst firing in dopamine neurons both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, the bursting is unusual in that spiking persists during the hyperpolarized trough and frequently terminates by depolarization block during the plateau. We focus on the underlying plateau potential oscillation generated in the presence of both apamin and TTX, so that action potentials are not considered. We find that although the plateau potentials are mediated by a voltage-gated Ca(2+) current, they do not depend on the accumulation of cytosolic Ca(2+), then use a computational model to test the hypothesis that the slowly voltage-activated ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) potassium current repolarizes the plateaus. The model, which includes a material balance on calcium, is able to reproduce the time course of both membrane potential and somatic calcium concentration, and can also mimic the induction of plateau potentials by the calcium chelator BAPTA. The principle of separation of timescales was used to gain insight into the mechanisms of oscillation and its modulation using nullclines in the phase space. The model predicts that the plateau will be elongated and ultimately result in a persistent depolarization as the ERG current is reduced. This study suggests that the ERG current may play a role in burst termination and the relief of depolarization block in vivo.},

The method is based on the tabulated open loop pulsatile interactions of bursting neurons on a cycle-by-cycle basis and was tested in closed loop hybrid circuits composed of one bursting biological neuron and one bursting model neuron coupled using the dynamic clamp. A total of 164 hybrid networks were formed by varying the synaptic conductances. The prediction of 1:1 phase locking agreed qualitatively with the experimental observations, except in three hybrid circuits in which 1:1 locking was predicted but not observed. Correct predictions sometimes required consideration of the second order phase resetting, which measures the change in the timing of the second burst after the perturbation. The method was robust to offsets between the initiation of bursting in the presynaptic neuron and the activation of the synaptic coupling with the postsynaptic neuron. The quantitative accuracy of the predictions fell within the variability (10%) in the experimentally observed intrinsic period and phase resetting curve (PRC), despite changes in the burst duration of the neurons between open and closed loop conditions.},

	Abstract = {Recordings of the membrane potential from a bursting neuron were used to reconstruct the phase curve for that neuron for a limited set of perturbations. These perturbations were inhibitory synaptic conductance pulses able to shift the membrane potential below the most hyperpolarized level attained in the free running mode. The extraction of the phase resetting curve from such a one-dimensional time series requires reconstruction of the periodic activity in the form of a limit cycle attractor. Resetting was found to have two components. In the first component, if the pulse was applied during a burst, the burst was truncated, and the time until the next burst was shortened in a manner predicted by movement normal to the limit cycle. By movement normal to the limit cycle, we mean a switch between two well-defined solution branches of a relaxation-like oscillator in a hysteretic manner enabled by the existence of a singular dominant slow process (variable). In the second component, the onset of the burst was delayed until the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse. Thus, for the pulse amplitudes we studied, resetting was independent of amplitude but increased linearly with pulse duration. The predicted and the experimental phase resetting curves for a pyloric dilator neuron show satisfactory agreement. The method was applied to only one pulse per cycle, but our results suggest it could easily be generalized to accommodate multiple inputs.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the phenomenology of phase resetting is an essential step toward developing a formalism for the analysis of circuits composed of bursting neurons that receive multiple, and sometimes overlapping, inputs. If we are to use phase-resetting methods to analyze these circuits, we can either generate phase-resetting curves (PRCs) for all possible inputs and combinations of inputs, or we can develop an understanding of how to construct PRCs for arbitrary perturbations of a given neuron. The latter strategy is the goal of this study. We present a geometrical derivation of phase resetting of neural limit cycle oscillators in response to short current pulses. A geometrical phase is defined as the distance traveled along the limit cycle in the appropriate phase space. The perturbations in current are treated as displacements in the direction corresponding to membrane voltage. We show that for type I oscillators, the direction of a perturbation in current is nearly tangent to the limit cycle; hence, the projection of the displacement in voltage onto the limit cycle is sufficient to give the geometrical phase resetting. In order to obtain the phase resetting in terms of elapsed time or temporal phase, a mapping between geometrical and temporal phase is obtained empirically and used to make the conversion. This mapping is shown to be an invariant of the dynamics. Perturbations in current applied to type II oscillators produce significant normal displacements from the limit cycle, so the difference in angular velocity at displaced points compared to the angular velocity on the limit cycle must be taken into account. Empirical attempts to correct for differences in angular velocity (amplitude versus phase effects in terms of a circular coordinate system) during relaxation back to the limit cycle achieved some success in the construction of phase-resetting curves for type II model oscillators. The ultimate goal of this work is the extension of these techniques to biological circuits comprising type II neural oscillators, which appear frequently in identified central pattern-generating circuits.},

Fluctuations between conducting and nonconducting states give rise to noisy membrane currents and subthreshold voltage fluctuations and may contribute to variability in spike timing. Here we study subthreshold voltage fluctuations due to active voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels as predicted by two commonly used kinetic schemes: the Mainen et al. (1995) (MJHS) kinetic scheme, which has been used to model dendritic channels in cortical neurons, and the classical Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) (HH) kinetic scheme for the squid giant axon. We compute the magnitudes, amplitude distributions, and power spectral densities of the voltage noise in isopotential membrane patches predicted by these kinetic schemes. For both schemes, noise magnitudes increase rapidly with depolarization from rest. Noise is larger for smaller patch areas but is smaller for increased model temperatures. We contrast the results from Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic nonlinear kinetic schemes with analytical, closed-form expressions derived using passive and quasi-active linear approximations to the kinetic schemes. For all subthreshold voltage ranges, the quasi-active linearized approximation is accurate within 8% and may thus be used in large-scale simulations of realistic neuronal geometries.},

Determining the variability of spike timing can provide fundamental insights into the nature of strategies used in the brain to represent and transmit information in the form of discrete spike trains. In this study, we employ a signal estimation paradigm to determine how variability in spike timing affects encoding of random time-varying signals. We assess this for two types of spiking models: an integrate-and-fire model with random threshold and a more biophysically realistic stochastic ion channel model. Using the coding fraction and mutual information as information-theoretic measures, we quantify the efficacy of optimal linear decoding of random inputs from the model outputs and study the relationship between efficacy and variability in the output spike train. Our findings suggest that variability does not necessarily hinder signal decoding for the biophysically plausible encoders examined and that the functional role of spiking variability depends intimately on the nature of the encoder and the signal processing task; variability can either enhance or impede decoding performance.},

The observed current noise increased with depolarization, as ion channels were activated, and its spectrum demonstrated generalized 1/f behavior. Exposure to TTX removed a significant contribution from Na+ channels to the noise spectrum, particularly at depolarized potentials, and the resulting spectrum was now dominated by a single Lorentzian (1/f2) component. By replacing the intracellular K+ with Cs+, we demonstrated that a major portion of the observed noise was attributable to K+ channels. We compared the measured power spectral densities to a 1-D cable model of channel fluctuations based on Markov kinetics. We found that a somatic compartment, in combination with a single equivalent cylinder, described the effective geometry from the viewpoint of the soma. Four distinct channel populations were distributed in the membrane and modeled as Lorentzian current noise sources. Using the NEURON simulation program, we summed up the contributions from the spatially distributed current noise sources and calculated the total voltage and current noise. Our quantitative model reproduces important voltage- and frequency-dependent features of the data, accounting for the 1/f behavior, as well as the effects of various blockers.},

	Abstract = {Neurones are noisy elements. Noise arises from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources, and manifests itself as fluctuations in the membrane potential. These fluctuations limit the accuracy of a neurone's output but have also been suggested to play a computational role. We present a detailed study of the amplitude and spectrum of voltage noise recorded at the soma of layer IV-V pyramidal neurones in slices taken from rat neocortex. The dependence of the noise on holding potential, synaptic activity and Na+ conductance is systematically analysed. We demonstrate that voltage noise increases non-linearly as the cell depolarizes (from a standard deviation (s.d.) of 0.19 mV at -75 mV to an s.d. of 0.54 mV at -55 mV). The increase in voltage noise is accompanied by an increase in the cell impedance, due to voltage dependence of Na+ conductance. The impedance increase accounts for the majority (70%) of the voltage noise increase. The increase in voltage noise and impedance is restricted to the low-frequency range (0.2-2 Hz). At the high frequency range (5-100 Hz) the voltage noise is dominated by synaptic activity. In our slice preparation, synaptic noise has little effect on the cell impedance. A minimal model reproduces qualitatively these data. Our results imply that ion channel noise contributes significantly to membrane voltage fluctuations at the subthreshold voltage range, and that Na+ conductance plays a key role in determining the amplitude of this noise by acting as a voltage-dependent amplifier of low-frequency transients.},

We explored various linear and nonlinear methods to detect weak synchronization in this network, using cross-correlation, mutual information in one and two dimensions, and phase correlation in both broad and narrow band. The linear and nonlinear methods demonstrated different patterns of sensitivity to detect synchrony in this network, depending on the dynamical state of the network. Bursts in 4-amino-pyridine (4AP) were highly synchronous events. Unexpectedly, seizure-like events in 4AP were desynchronous events, both in comparison with interictal periods preceding the seizure without bursts (cut Schaffer collateral tract) and in comparison with bursts preceding the seizures (intact Schaffer collateral tract). The finding that seizure-like events are associated with desynchronization in such networks is consistent with recent theoretical work, suggesting that asynchrony is necessary to maintain a high level of activity in neuronal networks for sustained periods of time and that synchrony may disrupt such activity.},

	Abstract = {We propose a simple, robust, linear method to control the spike timing of a periodically firing neuron. The control scheme uses the neuron's phase response curve to identify an area of optimal sensitivity for the chosen stimulation parameters. The spike advance as a function of current pulse amplitude is characterized at the optimal phase and a linear least-squares regression is fit to the data. The inverted regression is used as the control function for this method. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley style neuron model as well as in real neurons from rat hippocampal slice preparations. The study shows a proof of concept for the application of a linear control scheme to control neuron spike timing in-vitro. This study was done on an individual cell level, but translation to a tissue or network level is possible. Control schemes of this type could be implemented in a closed loop implantable device to treat neuromotor disorders involving pathologically neuronal activity such as epilepsy or Parkinson's disease.},

	Abstract = {The dynamic clamp protocol allows an experimenter to simulate the presence of membrane conductances in, and synaptic connections between, biological neurons. Existing protocols and commercial ADC/DAC boards provide ready control in and between < or =2 neurons. Control at >2 sites is desirable when studying neural circuits with serial or ring connectivity. Here, we describe how to extend dynamic clamp control to four neurons and their associated synaptic interactions, using a single IBM-compatible PC, an ADC/DAC interface with two analog outputs, and an additional demultiplexing circuit. A specific C++ program, DYNCLAMP4, implements these procedures in a Windows environment, allowing one to change parameters while the dynamic clamp is running. Computational efficiency is increased by varying the duration of the input-output cycle. The program simulates < or =8 Hodgkin-Huxley-type conductances and < or =18 (chemical and/or electrical) synapses in < or =4 neurons and runs at a minimum update rate of 5 kHz on a 450 MHz CPU. (Increased speed is possible in a two-neuron version that does not need auxiliary circuitry). Using identified neurons of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, we illustrate on-line parameter modification and the construction of three-member synaptic rings.},

	Abstract = {Periodic current forcing was used to investigate the intrinsic dynamics of a small group of electrically coupled neurons in the pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of the lobster. This group contains three neurons, namely the two pyloric dilator (PD) motoneurons and the anterior burster (AB) interneuron. Intracellular current injection, using sinusoidal waveforms of varying amplitude and frequency, was applied in three configurations of the pacemaker neurons: 1) the complete pacemaker group, 2) the two PDs without the AB, and 3) the AB neuron isolated from the PDs. Depending on the frequency and amplitude of the injected current, the intact pacemaker group exhibited a wide variety of nonlinear behaviors, including synchronization to the forcing, quasiperiodicity, and complex dynamics. In contrast, a single, broad 1:1 entrainment zone characterized the response of the PD neurons when isolated from the main pacemaker neuron AB. The isolated AB responded to periodic forcing in a manner similar to the complete pacemaker group, but with wider zones of synchronization. We have built an analog electronic circuit as an implementation of a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model for simulating the membrane potential activity of pyloric neurons. We subjected this electronic model neuron to the same periodic forcing as used in the biological experiments. This four-dimensional electronic model neuron reproduced the autonomous oscillatory firing patterns of biological pyloric pacemaker neurons, and it expressed the same stationary nonlinear responses to periodic forcing as its biological counterparts. This adds to our confidence in the model. These results strongly support the idea that the intact pyloric pacemaker group acts as a uniform low-dimensional deterministic nonlinear oscillator, and the regular pyloric oscillation is the outcome of cooperative behavior of strongly coupled neurons, having different dynamical and biophysical properties when isolated.},

	Abstract = {The pyloric network of the lobster stomatogastric nervous system is one of the best described assemblies of oscillatory neurons producing bursts of action potentials. While the temporal patterns of bursts have been investigated in detail, those of spikes have received less attention. Here we analyze the intraburst firing patterns of pyloric neurons and the synaptic interactions shaping their dynamics in millisecond time scales not performed before. We find that different pyloric neurons express characteristic, cell-specific firing patterns in their bursts. Nonlinear analysis of the interspike intervals (ISIs) reveals distinctive temporal structures ('interspike interval signatures'), which are found to depend on the synaptic connectivity of the network. We compare ISI patterns of the pyloric dilator (PD), lateral pyloric (LP), and ventricular dilator (VD) neurons in 1) normal conditions, 2) after blocking glutamatergic synaptic connections, and 3) in various functional configurations of the three neurons. Manipulation of the synaptic connectivity results in characteristic changes in the ISI signatures of the postsynaptic neurons. The intraburst firing pattern of the PD neuron is regularized by the inhibitory synaptic connection from the LP neuron as revealed in current-clamp experiments and also as reconstructed with a dynamic clamp. On the other hand, mutual inhibition between the LP and VD neurons tend to produce more irregular bursts with increased spike jitter. The results show that synaptic interactions fine-tune the output of pyloric neurons. The present data also suggest a way of processing of synaptic information: bursting neurons are capable of encoding incoming signals by altering the fine structure of their intraburst spike patterns.},

We use a well known compact motor network, the lobster pyloric CPG to study principles of intercircuit synchronization. We couple separate pyloric circuits obtained from two animals via artificial synapses and observe how their synchronization depends on the topology and kinetic parameters of the computer-generated synapses. Stable in-phase synchronization appears when electrically coupling the pacemaker groups of the two networks, but reciprocal inhibitory connections produce more robust and regular cooperative activity. Contralateral inhibitory connections offer effective synchronization and flexible setting of the burst phases of the interacting networks. We also show that a conductance-based mathematical model of the coupled circuits correctly reproduces the observed dynamics illustrating the generality of the phenomena.},

	Abstract = {A simple neuromechanical model has been developed that describes a spinal central pattern generator (CPG) controlling the locomotor movement of a single-joint limb via activation of two antagonist (flexor and extensor) muscles. The limb performs rhythmic movements under control of the muscular, gravitational and ground reaction forces. Muscle afferents provide length-dependent (types Ia and II) and force-dependent (type Ib from the extensor) feedback to the CPG. We show that afferent feedback adjusts CPG operation to the kinematics and dynamics of the limb providing stable "locomotion." Increasing the supraspinal drive to the CPG increases locomotion speed by reducing the duration of stance phase. We show that such asymmetric, extensor-dominated control of locomotor speed (with relatively constant swing duration) is provided by afferent feedback independent of the asymmetric rhythmic pattern generated by the CPG alone (in "fictive locomotion" conditions). Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of reestablishing stable locomotion after removal of the supraspinal drive (associated with spinal cord injury) by increasing the weights of afferent inputs to the CPG, which is thought to occur following locomotor training.},

	Abstract = {This meta-analysis quantitatively summarized the developmental influence and the effects of locomotor experience as well as the benefits of locomotor practice, locomotor assistance, and active searching patterns on children's search performance. Based on specific criteria, a search of a database and reference lists identified 19 studies, including 1,029 children (510 boys and 519 girls) from 4 to 144 months of age. Outcome measures of spatial performance were converted to 83 effect sizes that reflected the effects of specific experimental characteristics. Analyses of variance indicated that with older children, locomotor activities are more important to their spatial searching. Locomotor status, searching patterns, locomotor assistance, test conditions, and test reliability were identified as moderator variables. In addition, locomotor training significantly improved children's spatial search. The results supported the hypothesis that children's development of spatial search skills is influenced by locomotor experience.},

	Abstract = {Exercise, a behavior that is inherently associated with energy metabolism, impacts the molecular systems important for synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. This implies that a close association must exist between these systems to ensure proper neuronal function. This review emphasizes the ability of exercise and other lifestyle implementations that modulate energy metabolism, such as diet, to impact brain function. Mechanisms believed to interface metabolism and cognition seem to play a critical role with the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) system. Behaviors concerned with activity and metabolism may have developed simultaneously and interdependently during evolution to determine the influence of exercise and diet on cognition. A look into our evolutionary past indicates that our genome remains unchanged from the times of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, whose active lifestyle predominated throughout almost 100\% of humankind's existence. Consequently, the sedentary lifestyle and eating behaviors enabled by the comforts of technologic progress may be reaping "revenge" on the health of both our bodies and brains. In the 21st century we are confronted by the ever-increasing incidence of metabolic disorders in both the adult and child population. The ability of exercise and diet to impact systems that promote cell survival and plasticity may be applicable for combating the deleterious effects of disease and ageing on brain health and cognition.},

	Abstract = {This commentary reviews selected biomedical and clinical research examining the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive function especially in youth with disability. Youth with physical disability may not benefit from the effects of exercise on cardiovascular fitness and brain health since they are less active than their non-disabled peers. In animal models, physical activity enhances memory and learning, promotes neurogenesis and protects the nervous system from injury and neurodegenerative disease. Neurotrophins, endogenous proteins that support brain plasticity likely mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on the brain. In clinical studies, exercise increases brain volume in areas implicated in executive processing, improves cognition in children with cerebral palsy and enhances phonemic skill in school children with reading difficulty. Studies examining the intensity of exercise required to optimize neurotrophins suggest that moderation is important. Sustained increases in neurotrophin levels occur with prolonged low intensity exercise, while higher intensity exercise, in a rat model of brain injury, elevates the stress hormone, corticosterone. Clearly, moderate physical activity is important for youth whose brains are highly plastic and perhaps even more critical for young people with physical disability.},

	Abstract = {Fundamental properties of phasic firing neurons are usually characterized in a noise-free condition. In the absence of noise, phasic neurons exhibit Class 3 excitability, which is a lack of repetitive firing to steady current injections. For time-varying inputs, phasic neurons are band-pass filters or slope detectors, because they do not respond to inputs containing exclusively low frequencies or shallow slopes. However, we show that in noisy conditions, response properties of phasic neuron models are distinctly altered. Noise enables a phasic model to encode low-frequency inputs that are outside of the response range of the associated deterministic model. Interestingly, this seemingly stochastic-resonance (SR) like effect differs significantly from the classical SR behavior of spiking systems in both the signal-to-noise ratio and the temporal response pattern. Instead of being most sensitive to the peak of a subthreshold signal, as is typical in a classical SR system, phasic models are most sensitive to the signal's rising and falling phases where the slopes are steep. This finding is consistent with the fact that there is not an absolute input threshold in terms of amplitude; rather, a response threshold is more properly defined as a stimulus slope/frequency. We call the encoding of low-frequency signals with noise by phasic models a slope-based SR, because noise can lower or diminish the slope threshold for ramp stimuli. We demonstrate here similar behaviors in three mechanistic models with Class 3 excitability in the presence of slow-varying noise and we suggest that the slope-based SR is a fundamental behavior associated with general phasic properties rather than with a particular biological mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Spike generation in cortical neurons depends on the interplay between diverse intrinsic conductances. The phase response curve (PRC) is a measure of the spike time shift caused by perturbations of the membrane potential as a function of the phase of the spike cycle of a neuron. Near the rheobase, purely positive (type I) phase-response curves are associated with an onset of repetitive firing through a saddle-node bifurcation, whereas biphasic (type II) phase-response curves point towards a transition based on a Hopf-Andronov bifurcation. In recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in cortical slices, cholinergic action, consistent with down-regulation of slow voltage-dependent potassium currents such as the M-current, switched the PRC from type II to type I. This is the first report showing that cholinergic neuromodulation may cause a qualitative switch in the PRCs type implying a change in the fundamental dynamical mechanism of spike generation.},

	Abstract = {How are the same muscles and neurons used to generate qualitatively different behaviors? We studied this question by analyzing the biomechanical and neural mechanisms of rejection responses in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica and compared these mechanisms with those used to generate swallowing responses (Ye et al., 2006). During rejection, the central grasper of the feeding structure closes to push inedible food out of the buccal cavity. This contrasts with swallowing, during which the grasper is open as it moves toward the jaws (protracts). We examined how the shape change of the grasper during rejection mechanically reconfigured the surrounding musculature. Grasper shape change increased the effectiveness of protractor muscle I2. The closed grasper alters the function of another muscle, the hinge, which becomes capable of inducing ventral rotations of rejected material. In contrast, during large-amplitude swallows, the hinge muscle mediates dorsal rotations of ingested material. Finally, after the grasper opens, its change in shape induces a delay in the activation of other surrounding muscles, the I1/I3/jaw complex, whose premature activation would close the halves of the grasper and induce it to pull inedible material back inward. The delay in activation of the I1/I3/jaw complex is partially attributable to identified multiaction neurons B4/B5. The results suggest that multifunctionality emerges from a periphery in which flexible coalitions of muscles may perform different functions in different mechanical contexts and in which neural circuitry is capable of reorganizing to exploit these coalitions by changes in phasing, duration, and intensity of motor neuronal activation.},

@article{Weiss:1986ve,
	Abstract = {The possible functions of histaminergic neuron C2 were studied in an isolated head preparation from which it was possible to obtain intracellular recordings while the buccal mass exhibited feeding-like responses. Application of food to the lips of the isolated head preparation elicited rhythmic buccal movements that appeared to be ingestion responses, since they moved seaweed into the buccal cavity and towards the esophagus, and their frequency and regularity was similar to the ingestion responses studied in a group of intact animals. The ingestion responses of the buccal mass consisted of 2 main phases of movement of the radula from a middle rest position: forward and return to rest, and backward and return to rest. The relative magnitudes and timing of these 2 phases were variable. Intracellular recordings from C2 in the isolated head revealed that C2 is silent when the buccal mass is quiescent, but that it can be excited into spike activity, either by mechanical stimulation of the perioral zone or by chemostimulation that results in rhythmic movement. C2 fires a burst of spikes in phase with each protraction-retraction cycle, and, if the movements continue, C2 fires even when the eliciting stimulus has been removed. Activity of the cell was usually preceded by fast depolarizing responses that appeared to be blocked axon spikes. The evidence suggests that C2 is part of a positive feedback loop that may help maintain the persistence of arousal of feeding behavior beyond the time that food stimuli are removed.},

	Abstract = {1. B31 and B32 are pattern-initiator neurons in the buccal ganglia of Aplysia. Along with the B61/B62 neurons, B31/B32 are also motor neurons that innervate the 12 buccal muscle via the I2 nerve. This research was aimed at determining the physiological functions of the B31/B32 and B61/B62 neurons, and of the I2 muscle. 2. Stimulating the I2 muscle in the radula rest position produces radula protraction. In addition, in behaving animals lesioning either the muscle or the I2 nerve greatly reduces radula protraction. 3. During buccal motor programs in reduced preparations, B31/B32 and B61/62 fire preceding activity in neuron B4, whose firing indicates the onset of radula retraction. In addition, during both ingestion-like and rejection-like patterns the activity in the I2 nerve is correlated with protraction. 4. B31/B32 fire at frequencies of 15-25 Hz. Neither B31/B32 nor B61/B62 elicit facilitating end-junction potentials (EJPs) and electromyograms (EMGs) in the I2 muscle. EMGs from B31/B32 are smaller than those from B61/B62. B31/B32 and B61/B62 innervate all areas of the muscle approximately uniformly. 5. In behaving animals, EMGs consistent with B31/B32 activity are seen in the I2 muscle during the protraction phase of biting, swallowing, and rejection movements. In addition, the I2 muscle receives inputs that cannot be attributed to either the B31/B32 or B61/B62 neurons, either because the potentials are too large, firing frequencies are too low, or a prominent facilitation is seen. Such potentials are associated with lip movements, and also with radula retraction. 6. EMGs were recorded from the I2 muscle during feeding behavior after a lesion of the I2 nerve. Animals that had severe deficits in protraction showed no activity consistent with B31/B32 or B61/B62, but did show activity during retraction. 7. Our data indicate that the I2 muscle and the B31/B32 motor neurons are essential constituents contributing to protraction movements. Activity in these neurons is associated with radula protraction, which occurs as a component of a number of different feeding movements. The I2 muscle may also contribute to retraction, via activation by other motor neurons.},

	Abstract = {Bernstein (1967) hypothesized that preparation of the periphery was crucial for correct responses to motor output. To test this hypothesis in a behaving animal, we examined the roles of two identified motor neurons, B7 and B8, which contribute to feeding behavior in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Neuron B7 innervates a hinge muscle and has no overt behavioral effect during smaller-amplitude (type A) swallows, because the hinge muscle is too short to exert force. Neuron B8 activates a muscle (I4) that acts solely to grasp material during type A swallows. During larger-amplitude (type B) swallows, the behavioral actions of both motor neurons change, because the larger-amplitude anterior movement of the grasper sets up the periphery to respond differently to motor outputs. The larger anterior movement stretches the hinge muscle, so that activating neuron B7 mediates the initial retraction phase of swallowing. The changed position of the I4 muscle allows neuron B8 not only to induce grasping but also to pull material into the buccal cavity, contributing to retraction. Thus, larger-amplitude swallows are associated with the expression of two new degrees of freedom (use of the hinge to retract and use of the grasper to retract) that are essential for mediating type B swallows. These results provide a direct demonstration of Bernstein's hypothesis that properly positioning the periphery can be crucial for its ability to correctly respond to motor output and also demonstrate that biomechanical context can alter the functions of identified motor neurons.},

	Abstract = {A novel magnetic resonance imaging interface has been developed that makes it possible to image movements in intact, freely moving subjects. We have used this interface to image the internal structures of the feeding apparatus (i.e. the buccal mass) of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica. The temporal and spatial resolution of the resulting images is sufficient to describe the kinematics of specific muscles of the buccal mass and the internal movements of the main structures responsible for grasping food, the radula and the odontophore. These observations suggest that a previously undescribed feature on the anterior margin of the odontophore, a fluid-filled structure that we term the prow, may aid in opening the jaw lumen early in protraction. Radular closing during swallowing occurs near the peak of protraction as the radular stalk is pushed rapidly out of the odontophore. Retraction of the odontophore is enhanced by the closure of the lumen of the jaws on the elongated odontophore, causing the odontophore to rotate rapidly towards the esophagus. Radular opening occurs after the peak of retraction and without the active contraction of the protractor muscle 12 and is due, in part, to the movement of the radular stalk into the odontophore. The large variability between responses also suggests that the great flexibility of swallowing responses may be due to variability in neural control and in the biomechanics of the ingested food and to the inherent flexibility of the buccal mass.},

	Abstract = {Recording from key nerves and muscles of Aplysia during feeding behavior allows us to study the patterns of neural control in an intact animal. Simultaneously recording from multiple nerves and muscles gives us precise information about the timing of neural activity. Previous recording methods have worked for two electrodes, but the study of additional nerves or muscles required combining and averaging the recordings of multiple animals, which made it difficult to determine fine details of timing and phasing, because of variability from response to response, and from animal to animal. Implanting four individual electrodes has a very low success rate due to the formation of adhesions that prevent animals from performing normal feeding movements. We developed a new method of electrode fabrication that reduces the bulk of the electrodes inside the animal allowing for normal feeding movements. Using a combination of glues to attach the electrodes results in a more reliable insulation of the electrode which lasts longer, making it possible to record for periods as long as a week. The fabrication technique that we describe could be extended to incorporate several additional electrodes, and would be applicable to vertebrate animals.},

	Abstract = {Muscular hydrostats, such as tongues, trunks or tentacles, have fewer constraints on their degrees of freedom than musculoskeletal systems, so changes in a structure's shape may alter the positions and lengths of other components (i.e., induce mechanical reconfiguration). We studied mechanical reconfiguration during rejection and swallowing in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. During rejection, inedible material is pushed out of an animal's buccal cavity. The grasper (radula/odontophore) closes on inedible material, and then a posterior muscle, I2, pushes the grasper toward the jaws (protracts it). After the material is released, an anterior muscle complex (the I1/I3/jaw complex) pushes the grasper toward the esophagus (retracts it). During swallowing, the grasper is protracted open, and then retracts closed, pulling in food. Grasper closure changes its shape. Magnetic resonance images show that grasper closure lengthens I2. A kinetic model quantified the changes in the ability of I2 and I1/I3 to exert force as grasper shape changed. Grasper closure increases I2's ability to protract during rejection, and increases I1/I3's ability to retract during swallowing. Motor neurons controlling radular closure may therefore affect the behavioral outputs of I2's and I1/I3's motor neurons. Thus, motor neurons may modulate the outputs of other motor neurons through mechanical reconfiguration.},

	Abstract = {Swallowing and biting responses in the marine mollusk Aplysia are both mediated by a cyclical alternation of protraction and retraction movements of the grasping structure, the radula and underlying odontophore, within the feeding apparatus of the animal, the buccal mass. In vivo observations demonstrate that Aplysia biting is associated with strong protractions and rapid initial retractions, whereas Aplysia swallowing is associated with weaker protractions and slower initial retractions. During biting, the musculature joining the radula/odontophore to the buccal mass (termed the "hinge") is stretched more than in swallowing. To test the hypothesis that stretch of the hinge might contribute to rapid retractions observed in biting, we analyzed the hinge's passive properties. During biting, the hinge is stretched sufficiently to assist retraction. In contrast, during swallowing, the hinge is not stretched sufficiently for its passive forces to assist retraction, because the odontophore's anterior movement is smaller than during biting. A quantitative model demonstrated that steady-state passive forces were sufficient to generate the retraction movements observed during biting. Experimental measures of the relative magnitude of the hinge's active and passive forces at the protraction displacements of biting suggest that passive forces are at least a third of the total force.},

	Abstract = {Two kinematic models of the radula/odontophore of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica were created to characterize the movement of structures inside the buccal mass during the feeding cycle in vivo. Both models produce a continuous range of three-dimensional shape changes in the radula/odontophore, but they are fundamentally different in construction. The radulacentric model treats the radular halves as rigid bodies that can pitch, yaw and roll relative to a fixed radular stalk, thus creating a three-dimensional shape. The odontophore-centric model creates a globally convex solid representation of the radula/odontophore directly, which then constrains the positions and shapes of internal structures. Both radula/odontophore models are placed into a pre-existing kinematic model of the I1/I3 and I2 muscles to generate three-dimensional representations of the entire buccal mass. High-temporal-resolution, mid-sagittal magnetic resonance (MR) images of swallowing adults in vivo are used to provide non-invasive, artifact-free shape and position parameter inputs for the models. These images allow structures inside the buccal mass to be visualized directly, including the radula, radular stalk and lumen of the I1/I3 cavity. Both radula-centric and odontophore-centric models were able to reproduce two-dimensional, mid-sagittal radula/odontophore and buccal mass kinematics, but the odontophore-centric model's predictions of I1/I3, I2 and I7 muscle dimensions more accurately matched data from MR-imaged adults and transilluminated juveniles.},

CPGs can produce meaningful functional output in the absence of sensory inputs. Neocortical circuits could be considered analogous to CPGs as they have rich spontaneous dynamics that, similar to CPGs, are powerfully modulated or engaged by sensory inputs, but can also generate output in their absence. We find compelling evidence for this argument at the anatomical, biophysical, developmental, dynamic and pathological levels of analysis. Although it is possible that cortical circuits are particularly plastic types of CPG ('learning CPGs'), we argue that present knowledge about CPGs is likely to foretell the basic principles of the organization and dynamic function of cortical circuits.},

	Abstract = {The swimming behaviour of lower vertebrates has been used as a model to study the function of simple neuronal circuits. Good examples are the lamprey and the Xenopus tadpole. In these two cases, glutamate-activated NMDA receptors are involved, and the relative importance of the NMDA and non-NMDA receptors as well as the involvement of other ion channels has been studied using a combination of electrophysiological recordings and modelling experiments, but little attention had been paid to their evolution during development. In the present experiments, which have been performed on Xenopus embryos from stages 31 to 42, we have probed the relative importance of the two categories of receptors using selective blockers [respectively dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)]. The sensitivity of the swimming behaviour to APV was found to increase during development and that to CNQX to decrease. Furthermore, it has been observed that the spike activity recorded from the ventral roots is more complex in late embryonic stages that in early embryos. These modifications are associated with changes of the neuronal circuit, some of which correspond to a lengthening of the axon and an increased complexity of the dendritic tree of the motoneurons. We have incorporated these modifications in a simplified model of the central pattern generator built with Neuron software. The results indicate that at least part of the observed changes can be associated with changes in the length of the dendrites and axons.},

The first one relies on network dynamics within a segment to produce the rhythm, while the second contains bursting cells. We study intersegmental coordination and show that the former class of models shows more robust behavior over the animal's range of swimming frequencies. The network-based model can also easily produce approximately constant phase lags along the spinal cord, as observed experimentally. Precise control of phase lags in the network-based model is obtained by varying the relative strengths of its six different connection types with distance in a phase model with separate coupling functions for each connection type. The phase model also describes the effect of randomized connections, accurately predicting how quickly random network-based models approach the determinisitic model as the number of connections increases.},

@article{BemCabelguenEkebergGrillner:2003:BiolCyb,
	Abstract = {In this paper we consider the hypothesis that the spinal locomotor network controlling trunk movements has remained essentially unchanged during the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion. The wider repertoire of axial motor patterns expressed by amphibians would then be explained by the influence from separate limb pattern generators, added during this evolution. This study is based on EMG data recorded in vivo from epaxial musculature in the newt Pleurodeles waltl during unrestrained swimming and walking, and on a simplified model of the lamprey spinal pattern generator for swimming. Using computer simulations, we have examined the output generated by the lamprey model network for different input drives. Two distinct inputs were identified which reproduced the main features of the swimming and walking motor patterns in the newt. The swimming pattern is generated when the network receives tonic excitation with local intensity gradients near the neck and girdle regions. To produce the walking pattern, the network must receive (in addition to a tonic excitation at the girdles) a phasic drive which is out of phase in the neck and tail regions in relation to the middle part of the body. To fit the symmetry of the walking pattern, however, the intersegmental connectivity of the network had to be modified by reversing the direction of the crossed inhibitory pathways in the rostral part of the spinal cord. This study suggests that the input drive required for the generation of the distinct walking pattern could, at least partly, be attributed to mechanosensory feedback received by the network directly from the intraspinal stretch-receptor system. Indeed, the input drive required resembles the pattern of activity of stretch receptors sensing the lateral bending of the trunk, as expressed during walking in urodeles. Moreover, our results indicate that a nonuniform distribution of these stretch receptors along the trunk can explain the discontinuities exhibited in the swimming pattern of the newt. Thus, separate limb pattern generators can influence the original network controlling axial movements not only through a direct coupling at the central level but also via a mechanical coupling between trunk and limbs, which in turn influences the sensory signals sent back to the network. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis of a phylogenetic conservatism of the spinal locomotor networks generating axial motor patterns from agnathans to amphibians.},

The neural mechanisms for such phase coupling in vertebrate locomotion are not known. Swimming in the lamprey is accomplished by the generation of a travelling wave of body curvature in which the phase coupling between segments is so controlled as to give approximately one full wavelength on the body at any swimming speed. This article reviews work that has combined mathematical analysis, biological experimentation and computer simulation to provide a conceptual framework within which intersegmental coordination can be investigated. Evidence is provided to suggest that in the lamprey, ascending coupling is dominant over descending coupling and controls the intersegmental phase lag during locomotion. The significance of long-range intersegmental coupling is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {1. Application of D-glutamate to the isolated spinal cord of the lamprey produces phasic activity in ventral roots, which is similar to that of the muscles of the intact swimming animal (5,18). Therefore, the isolated spinal cord may be used as a convenient model for the investigation of the generation of locomotor rhythms in a vertebrate. 2. Almost all slow muscle fibers exhibited excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) during swimming activity. The number of EJPs per cycle increased with the intensity of ventral root (VR) bursting. Few twitch fibers were active, and these fired action potentials only during high intensities of VR bursts. 3. As was found by Russell and Wall{\'e}n (25), myotomal motoneurons had oscillating membrane potentials during fictive swimming which, on the average, reached a peak depolarization in the middle of the VR burst (phi = 0.21 +/- 0.05; phi = 0 is defined as the onset of the VR burst, and the duration of the cycle is set equal to 1). Membrane potential oscillations in fin motoneurons were antiphasic to those of nearby myotomal motoneurons (peak depolarization phi = 0.68 +/- 0.05). 4. Lateral interneurons had oscillating membrane potentials in synchrony with those of myotomal motoneurons (peak depolarization phi = 0.21 +/- 0.10). Interneurons with axons projecting contralaterally and caudally (CC interneurons) had oscillating membrane potentials that peaked significantly earlier in the cycle (peak depolarization phi = 0.06 +/- 0.12). 5. Edge cells were only weakly modulated during fictive swimming. Their peak depolarizations occurred near the end of the VR burst (phi = 0.33 +/- 0.10). Most giant interneurons were not phasically modulated during fictive swimming. 6. Repetitive intracellular stimulation of M{\"u}ller cells during fictive swimming generally evoked an increased burst intensity in ipsilateral VRs and a decreased burst intensity in contralateral VRs. The cells M3, B1, and B2 also produced increases or decreases in the frequency of VR bursts. Repetitive intracellular stimulation of sensory dorsal cells could also change the intensities and timing of VR bursts. 7. This study is an initial survey of lamprey spinal interneurons that participate in swimming activity. Lateral interneurons and CC interneurons are active during fictive swimming and probably help coordinate the undulations of the body, but their roles in pattern generation are not known. The central pattern generator is subject to modification by descending and sensory inputs.},

	Abstract = {The rhythmic and coordinated activation of axial muscles that underlie trunk movements during locomotion are generated by specialized networks in the spinal cord. The operation of these networks has been extensively investigated in limbless swimming vertebrates. But little is known about the architecture and functioning of the axial locomotor networks in limbed vertebrates. We investigated the rhythm-generating capacity of the axial segmental networks in the salamander (Pleurodeles waltlii). We recorded ventral root activity from hemisegments and segments that were surgically isolated from the mid-trunk cord and chemically activated with bath-applied N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). We provide evidence that the rhythmogenic capacity of the axial network is distributed along the mid-trunk spinal cord without an excitability gradient. We demonstrate that the burst generation in a hemisegment depends on glutamatergic excitatory interactions. Reciprocal glycinergic inhibition between opposite hemisegments ensures left-right alternation and lowers the rhythm frequency in segments. Our results further suggest that persistent sodium current contributes to the rhythmic regenerating process both in hemisegments and segments. Burst termination in hemisegments is not achieved through the activation of apamine-sensitive Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels and burst termination in segments relies on crossed glycinergic inhibition. Together our results indicate that the basic design of the salamander axial network is similar to most of axial networks investigated in other vertebrates, albeit with some significant differences in the cellular mechanism that underlies segmental bursting. This finding supports the view of a phylogenetic conservation of basic building blocks of the axial locomotor network among the vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {In the past, computational motor control has been approached from at least two major frameworks: the dynamic systems approach and the viewpoint of optimal control. The dynamic system approach emphasizes motor control as a process of self-organization between an animal and its environment. Nonlinear differential equations that can model entrainment and synchronization behavior are among the most favorable tools of dynamic systems modelers. In contrast, optimal control approaches view motor control as the evolutionary or development result of a nervous system that tries to optimize rather general organizational principles, e.g., energy consumption or accurate task achievement. Optimal control theory is usually employed to develop appropriate theories. Interestingly, there is rather little interaction between dynamic systems and optimal control modelers as the two approaches follow rather different philosophies and are often viewed as diametrically opposing. In this paper, we develop a computational approach to motor control that offers a unifying modeling framework for both dynamic systems and optimal control approaches. In discussions of several behavioral experiments and some theoretical and robotics studies, we demonstrate how our computational ideas allow both the representation of self-organizing processes and the optimization of movement based on reward criteria. Our modeling framework is rather simple and general, and opens opportunities to revisit many previous modeling results from this novel unifying view.},

Yet the increasing interest in finding a comprehensive model for movement generation requires bridging the different perspectives arising from the study of those two types of movements. In this article, we consider discrete and rhythmic movements within the framework of motor primitives, i.e., of modular generation of movements. In this way we hope to gain an insight into the functional relationships between discrete and rhythmic movements and thus into a suitable representation for both of them. Within this framework we can define four possible categories of modeling for discrete and rhythmic movements depending on the required command signals and on the spinal processes involved in the generation of the movements. These categories are first discussed in terms of biological concepts such as force fields and central pattern generators and then illustrated by several mathematical models based on dynamical system theory. A discussion on the plausibility of theses models concludes the work.},

Here, we introduce a new method to find an ODE which models both the short time and the long time dynamics. The experimental data are represented in a state space and the corresponding flow vectors are approximated by polynomials of the state vector components. We apply these methods both to simulated data and experimental data from human limb movements, which like many other biological systems can exhibit limit cycle dynamics. In systems with only one oscillator there is excellent agreement between the limit cycling displayed by the experimental system and the reconstructed model, even if the data are very noisy. Furthermore, we study systems of two coupled limit cycle oscillators. There, a reconstruction was only successful for data with a sufficiently long transient trajectory and relatively low noise level.},

	Abstract = {Limit cycle oscillators that are coupled in a pulsatile manner are referred to as pulse coupled oscillators. In these oscillators, the interactions take the form of brief pulses such that the effect of one input dies out before the next is received. A phase resetting curve (PRC) keeps track of how much an input advances or delays the next spike in an oscillatory neuron depending upon where in the cycle the input is applied. PRCs can be used to predict phase locking in networks of pulse coupled oscillators. In some studies of pulse coupled oscillators, a specific form is assumed for the interactions between oscillators, but a more general approach is to formulate the problem assuming a PRC that is generated using a perturbation that approximates the input received in the real biological network. In general, this approach requires that circuit architecture and a specific firing pattern be assumed. This allows the construction of discrete maps from one event to the next. The fixed points of these maps correspond to periodic firing modes and are easier to locate and analyze for stability compared to locating and analyzing periodic modes in the original network directly. Alternatively, maps based on the PRC have been constructed that do not presuppose a firing order. Specific circuits that have been analyzed under the assumption of pulsatile coupling include one to one lockings in a periodically forced oscillator or an oscillator forced at a fixed delay after a threshold event, two bidirectionally coupled oscillators with and without delays, a unidirectional N-ring of oscillators, and N all-to-all networks.},

	Abstract = {Periodic behavior is key to life and is observed in multiple instances and at multiple time scales in our metabolism, our natural environment, and our engineered environment. A natural way of modeling or generating periodic behavior is done by using oscillators, i.e., dynamical systems that exhibit limit cycle behavior. While there is extensive literature on methods to analyze such dynamical systems, much less work has been done on methods to synthesize an oscillator to exhibit some specific desired characteristics. The goal of this article is twofold: (1) to provide a framework for characterizing and designing oscillators and (2) to review how classes of well-known oscillators can be understood and related to this framework. The basis of the framework is to characterize oscillators in terms of their fundamental temporal and spatial behavior and in terms of properties that these two behaviors can be designed to exhibit. This focus on fundamental properties is important because it allows us to systematically compare a large variety of oscillators that might at first sight appear very different from each other. We identify several specifications that are useful for design, such as frequency-locking behavior, phase-locking behavior, and specific output signal shape. We also identify two classes of design methods by which these specifications can be met, namely offline methods and online methods. By relating these specifications to our framework and by presenting several examples of how oscillators have been designed in the literature, this article provides a useful methodology and toolbox for designing oscillators for a wide range of purposes. In particular, the focus on synthesis of limit cycle dynamical systems should be useful both for engineering and for computational modeling of physical or biological phenomena.},

	Abstract = {Aplysia consummatory feeding behavior, a rhythmic cycling of biting, swallowing, and rejection movements, is often said to be stereotyped. Yet closer examination shows that cycles of the behavior are very variable. Here we have quantified and analyzed the variability at several complementary levels in the neuromuscular system. In reduced preparations, we recorded the motor programs produced by the central pattern generator, firing of the motor neurons B15 and B16, and contractions of the accessory radula closer (ARC) muscle while repetitive programs were elicited by stimulation of the esophageal nerve. In other similar experiments, we recorded firing of motor neuron B48 and contractions of the radula opener muscle. In intact animals, we implanted electrodes to record nerve or ARC muscle activity while the animals swallowed controlled strips of seaweed or fed freely. In all cases, we found large variability in all parameters examined. Some of this variability reflected systematic, slow, history-dependent changes in the character of the central motor programs. Even when these trends were factored out, however, by focusing only on the differences between successive cycles, considerable variability remained. This variability was apparently random. Nevertheless, it too was the product of central history dependency because regularizing merely the high-level timing of the programs also regularized many of the downstream neuromuscular parameters. Central motor program variability thus appears directly in the behavior. With regard to the production of functional behavior in any one cycle, the large variability may indicate broad tolerances in the operation of the neuromuscular system. Alternatively, some cycles of the behavior may be dysfunctional. Overall, the variability may be part of an optimal strategy of trial, error, and stabilization that the CNS adopts in an uncertain environment.},

We propose that the behavior is variable nevertheless because the variability serves a higher-order functional purpose. When the animal is faced with a new and only imperfectly known feeding task in each cycle, the variability implements a trial-and-error search through the space of possible feeding movements.

	Abstract = {The accessory radula closer (ARC) muscle of Aplysia has long been studied as a typical "slow" muscle, one that would be assumed to respond only to the overall, integrated spike rate of its motor neurons, B15 and B16. The precise timing of the individual spikes should not much matter. However, but real B15 and B16 spike patterns recorded in vivo show great variability that extends down to the timing of individual spikes. By replaying these real as well as artificially constructed spike patterns into ARC muscles in vitro, we examined the consequences of this spike-level variability for contraction. Replaying the same pattern several times reproduces precisely the same contraction shape: the B15/B16-ARC neuromuscular transform is deterministic. However, varying the timing of the spikes produces very different contraction shapes and amplitudes. The transform in fact operates at an interface between "fast" and "slow" regimens. It is fast enough that the timing of individual spikes greatly influences the detailed contraction shape. At the same time, slow integration of the spike pattern through the nonlinear transform allows the variable spike timing to determine also the overall contraction amplitude. Indeed, the variability appears to be necessary to maintain the contraction amplitude at a robust level. This phenomenon is tuned by neuromodulators that tune the speed and nonlinearity of the transform. Thus, the variable timing of individual spikes does matter, in at least two, functionally significant ways, in this "slow" neuromuscular system.},

	Abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) consisting of interacting groups of neurons drive a variety of repetitive, rhythmic behaviors in invertebrates and vertebrates, such as arise in locomotion, respiration, mastication, scratching, and so on. These CPGs are able to generate rhythmic activity in the absence of afferent feedback or rhythmic inputs. However, functionally relevant CPGs must adaptively respond to changing demands, manifested as changes in oscillation period or in relative phase durations in response to variations in non-patterned inputs or drives. Although many half-center CPG models, composed of symmetric units linked by reciprocal inhibition yet varying in their intrinsic cellular properties, have been proposed, the precise oscillatory mechanisms operating in most biological CPGs remain unknown. Using numerical simulations and phase-plane analysis, we comparatively investigated how the intrinsic cellular features incorporated in different CPG models, such as subthreshold activation based on a slowly inactivating persistent sodium current, adaptation based on slowly activating calcium-dependent potassium current, or post-inhibitory rebound excitation, can contribute to the control of oscillation period and phase durations in response to changes in excitatory external drive to one or both half-centers. Our analysis shows that both the sensitivity of oscillation period to alterations of excitatory drive and the degree to which the duration of each phase can be separately controlled depend strongly on the intrinsic cellular mechanisms involved in rhythm generation and phase transitions. In particular, the CPG formed from units incorporating a slowly inactivating persistent sodium current shows the greatest range of oscillation periods and the greatest degree of independence in phase duration control by asymmetric inputs. These results are explained based on geometric analysis of the phase plane structures corresponding to the dynamics for each CPG type, which in particular helps pinpoint the roles of escape and release from synaptic inhibition in the effects we find.},

	Abstract = {In mammalian respiration, late-expiratory (late-E, or pre-inspiratory) oscillations emerge in abdominal motor output with increasing metabolic demands (e.g., during hypercapnia, hypoxia, etc.). These oscillations originate in the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) and couple with the respiratory oscillations generated by the interacting neural populations of the B{\"o}tzinger (B{\"o}tC) and pre-B{\"o}tzinger (pre-B{\"o}tC) complexes, representing the kernel of the respiratory central pattern generator. Recently, we analyzed experimental data on the generation of late-E oscillations and proposed a large-scale computational model that simulates the possible interactions between the B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC and RTN/pFRG oscillations under different conditions. Here we describe a reduced model that maintains the essential features and architecture of the large-scale model, but relies on simplified activity-based descriptions of neural populations. This simplification allowed us to use methods of dynamical systems theory, such as fast-slow decomposition, bifurcation analysis, and phase plane analysis, to elucidate the mechanisms and dynamics of synchronization between the RTN/pFRG and B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC oscillations. Three physiologically relevant behaviors have been analyzed: emergence and quantal acceleration of late-E oscillations during hypercapnia, transformation of the late-E activity into a biphasic-E activity during hypercapnic hypoxia, and quantal slowing of B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC oscillations with the reduction of pre-B{\"o}tC excitability. Each behavior is elicited by gradual changes in excitatory drives or other model parameters, reflecting specific changes in metabolic and/or physiological conditions. Our results provide important theoretical insights into interactions between RTN/pFRG and B{\"o}tC/pre-B{\"o}tC oscillations and the role of these interactions in the control of breathing under different metabolic conditions.},

Possible explanations include activity-dependent mechanisms driven by spontaneous activity in the retina and thalamus, and molecular guidance orchestrating thalamo-cortical connections on a fine spatial scale. Here I propose an alternative hypothesis: the blueprint for receptive fields, feature maps, and their inter-relationships may reside in the layout of the retinal ganglion cell mosaics along with a simple statistical connectivity scheme dictating the wiring between thalamus and cortex. The model is shown to account for a number of experimental findings, including the relationship between retinotopy, orientation maps, spatial frequency maps and cytochrome oxidase patches. The theory's simplicity, explanatory and predictive power makes it a serious candidate for the origin of the functional architecture of primary visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {In the visual cortex of higher mammals, neurons are arranged across the cortical surface in an orderly map of preferred stimulus orientations. This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution. We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits underlying orientation selectivity.},

Research on the functional anatomy of visual cortical circuits has recently zoomed in from the macroscopic level to the microscopic. High-resolution functional imaging has revealed that the functional architecture of orientation maps in higher mammals is built with single-cell precision. By contrast, orientation selectivity in rodents is dispersed on visual cortex in a salt-and-pepper fashion, despite highly tuned visual responses. Recent studies of synaptic physiology indicate that there are disjoint subnetworks of interconnected cells in the rodent visual cortex. These intermingled subnetworks, described in vitro, may relate to the intermingled ensembles of cells tuned to different orientations, described in vivo. This hypothesis may soon be tested with new anatomic techniques that promise to reveal the detailed wiring diagram of cortical circuits.},

	Abstract = {One of the most salient features to emerge in visual cortex is sensitivity to stimulus orientation. Here we asked if orientation selectivity, once established, is altered by successive stages of cortical processing. We measured patterns of orientation selectivity at all depths of the cat's visual cortex by making whole-cell recordings with dye-filled electrodes. Our results show that the synaptic representation of orientation indeed changes with position in the microcircuit, as information passes from layer 4 to layer 2+3 to layer 5. At the earliest cortical stage, for simple cells in layer 4, orientation tuning curves for excitation (depolarization) and inhibition (hyperpolarization) had similar peaks (within 0-7 deg, n = 11) and bandwidths. Further, the sharpness of orientation selectivity covaried with receptive field geometry (r = 0.74) - the more elongated the strongest subregion, the shaper the tuning. Tuning curves for complex cells in layer 2+3 also had similar peaks (within 0-4 deg, n = 7) and bandwidths. By contrast, at a later station, layer 5, the preferred orientation for excitation and inhibition diverged such that the peaks of the tuning curves could be as far as 90 deg apart (average separation, 54 deg; n = 6). Our results support the growing consensus that orientation selectivity is generated at the earliest cortical level and structured similarly for excitation and inhibition. Moreover, our novel finding that the relative tuning of excitation and inhibition changes with laminar position helps resolve prior controversy about orientation selectivity at later phases of processing and gives a mechanistic view of how the cortical circuitry recodes orientation.},

	Abstract = {Hundreds of thalamic axons ramify within a column of cat visual cortex; yet each layer 4 neuron receives input from only a fraction of them. We have examined the specificity of these connections by recording simultaneously from layer 4 simple cells and cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus with spatially overlapping receptive fields (n = 221 cell pairs). Because of the precise retinotopic organization of visual cortex, the geniculate axons and simple-cell dendrites of these cell pairs should have overlapped within layer 4. Nevertheless, monosynaptic connections were identified in only 33\% of all cases, as estimated by cross-correlation analysis. The visual responses of monosynaptically connected geniculate cells and simple cells were closely related. The probability of connection was greatest when a geniculate center overlapped a strong simple-cell subregion of the same sign (ON or OFF) near the center of the subregion. This probability was further increased when the time courses of the visual responses were similar. In addition, the connections were strongest when the simple-cell subregion and the geniculate center were matched in position, sign, and size. The rules of connectivity between geniculate afferents and simple cells resemble those found for retinal afferents to geniculate cells. The connections along the retinogeniculocortical pathway, therefore, show a precision that goes beyond simple retinotopy to include many other response properties, such as receptive-field sign, timing, subregion strength, and size. This specificity in wiring emphasizes the need for developmental mechanisms (presumably correlation-based) that can select among afferents that differ only slightly in their response properties.},

	Abstract = {We performed experiments in the cat geniculocortical pathway, in vivo, to examine how presynaptic spikes interact to influence the firing of postsynaptic targets. In particular, we asked (1) how do multiple spikes from a single presynaptic neuron interact to influence the firing of a postsynaptic target (homosynaptic interactions), (2) how do spikes from two different presynaptic neurons interact (heterosynaptic interactions), and (3) what is the time course of homosynaptic and heterosynaptic interactions? We found that both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic interactions increase the likelihood of driving a postsynaptic spike, although with different time courses. For two spikes traveling down a single geniculate axon, the second spike is more effective than the first for approximately 15 msec. For two spikes on separate axons, the interaction is faster ( approximately 7 msec duration, approximately 2.5 msec time constant). Thus changes in firing rate are perhaps best relayed by homosynaptic interactions, whereas heterosynaptic interactions may help detect coincident spikes from different thalamic inputs.},

Precisely correlated spiking, occurring on a millisecond time scale, has recently been observed among neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus with overlapping receptive fields. We have used an information-theoretic analysis to examine the role of these correlations in visual coding. Considerably more information can be extracted from two cells if temporal correlations between them are considered. The percentage increase in information depends on the degree of correlation; the average increase is approximately 20\% for strongly correlated pairs. Thus, precise temporal correlation could be used as an additional information channel from thalamus to visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Simple cells in the visual cortex respond to the precise position of oriented contours (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). This sensitivity reflects the structure of the simple receptive field, which exhibits two sorts of antagonism between on and off inputs. First, simple receptive fields are divided into adjacent on and off subregions; second, within each subregion, stimuli of the reverse contrast evoke responses of the opposite sign: push-pull (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Palmer and Davis, 1981; Jones and Palmer, 1987; Ferster, 1988). We have made whole-cell patch recordings from cat area 17 during visual stimulation to examine the generation and integration of excitation (push) and suppression (pull) in the simple receptive field. The temporal structure of the push reflected the pattern of thalamic inputs, as judged by comparing the intracellular cortical responses to extracellular recordings made in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Two mechanisms have been advanced to account for the pull-withdrawal of thalamic drive and active, intracortical inhibition (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Heggelund, 1968; Ferster, 1988). Our results suggest that intracortical inhibition is the dominant, and perhaps sole, mechanism of suppression. The inhibitory influences operated within a wide dynamic range. When inhibition was strong, the membrane conductance could be doubled or tripled. Furthermore, if a stimulus confined to one subregion was enlarged so that it extended into the next, the sign of response often changed from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. In other instances, the inhibition modulated neuronal output subtly, by elevating spike threshold or altering firing rate at a given membrane voltage.},

It has been proposed that their receptive-field properties are established by the pattern of connections that they receive from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Thalamic inputs, however, represent only a small proportion of the synapses made onto simple cells, and others have argued that corticocortical connections are likely to be important in shaping simple-cell response properties. Here we describe a mechanism that might be involved in selectively strengthening the effect of thalamic inputs. We show that neighbouring geniculate neurons with overlapping receptive fields of the same type (on-centre or off-centre) often fire spikes that are synchronized to within 1 millisecond. Moreover, these neurons often project to a common cortical target neuron where synchronous spikes are more effective in evoking a postsynaptic response. We propose that precisely correlated firing within a group of geniculate neurons could serve to reinforce the thalamic input to cortical simple cells.},

This dramatic transformation suggests that there are specific rules governing the connections made between thalamic and cortical neurons (see ref. 4). Here we report a study of these rules in which we recorded from thalamic (lateral geniculate nucleus; LGN) and cortical neurons simultaneously and related their receptive fields to their connectivity, as measured by cross-correlation analysis. The probability of finding a monosynaptic connection was high when a geniculate receptive field was superimposed anywhere over an elongated simple-cell subregion of the same signature (on or off). However, 'inappropriate' connections from geniculate cells of the opposite receptive field signature were extremely rare. Together, these findings imply that the outline of the elongated, simple receptive field, and thus of cortical orientation selectivity, is laid down at the level of the first synapse from the thalamic afferents.},

	Abstract = {In their pioneering studies of primary visual cortex, Hubel and Wiesel described the existence of two classes of cells, which they termed "simple" and "complex". The original classification scheme was based on a number of partly subjective tests of linear spatial summation. Later, investigators adopted an objective classification method based on the ratio between the amplitude of the first harmonic of the response and the mean spike rate (or the F(1)/F(0) ratio) when the neuron is stimulated with drifting sinusoidal gratings. This measure is bimodally distributed over the population and divides neurons into two classes that correspond closely to the classical definition by Hubel and Wiesel. Here we show that a simple rectification model can predict the observed bimodal distribution of F(1)/F(0) in primary visual cortex when the distributions of the intracellular response modulation and mean are unimodal. Thus, contrary to common belief, the bimodality of F(1)/F(0) does not necessarily imply the existence of two discrete cell classes. Furthermore, in reviewing the literature, we find no independent support for a simple/complex dichotomy. These results suggest that the existence of two distinct neural populations in primary visual cortex, and the associated hierarchical model of receptive field organization, need to be re-evaluated.},

	Abstract = {Retinotopy is a fundamental organizing principle of the visual cortex. Over the years, a variety of techniques have been used to examine it. None of these techniques, however, provides a way to rapidly characterize retinotopy, at the submillimeter range, in alert, behaving subjects. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) can be used to monitor neuronal population activity at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we present a VSDI protocol for rapid and precise retinotopic mapping in the behaving monkey. Two monkeys performed a fixation task while thin visual stimuli swept periodically at a high speed in one of two possible directions through a small region of visual space. Because visual space is represented systematically across the cortical surface, each moving stimulus produced a traveling wave of activity in the cortex that could be precisely measured with VSDI. The time at which the peak of the traveling wave reached each location in the cortex linked this location with its retinotopic representation. We obtained detailed retinotopic maps from a region of about 1 cm(2) over the dorsal portion of areas V1 and V2. Retinotopy obtained during <4 min of imaging had a spatial precision of 0.11-0.19 mm, was consistent across experiments, and reliably predicted the locations of the response to small localized stimuli. The ability to rapidly obtain precise retinotopic maps in behaving monkeys opens the door for detailed analysis of the relationship between spatiotemporal dynamics of population responses in the visual cortex and perceptually guided behavior.},

	Abstract = {To date, Hebbian learning combined with some form of constraint on synaptic inputs has been demonstrated to describe well the development of neural networks. The previous models revealed mathematically the importance of synaptic constraints to reproduce orientation selectivity in the visual cortical neurons, but biological mechanisms underlying such constraints remain unclear. In this study, we addressed this issue by formulating a synaptic constraint based on activity-dependent mechanisms of synaptic changes. Particularly, considering metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression, we derived synaptic constraint that suppresses the number of inputs from individual presynaptic neurons. We performed computer simulations of the activity-dependent self-organization of geniculocortical inputs with the synaptic constraint and examined the formation of receptive fields (RFs) of model visual cortical neurons. When we changed the magnitude of the synaptic constraint, we found the emergence of distinct RF structures such as concentric RFs, simple-cell-like RFs, and double-oriented RFs and also a gradual transition between spatiotemporal separable and inseparable RFs. Thus, the model based on the synaptic constraint derived from biological consideration can account systematically for the repertoire of RF structures observed in the primary visual cortices of different species for the first time.},

Using a model of activity-dependent self-organization of geniculo-cortical afferent inputs, we showed that spontaneous activity in the LGN can produce orientation maps, while the exposure to drifting gratings results in sharply segregated orientation maps as observed in cat visual cortex. The restricted exposure to a single orientation of the grating led to the over-representation of the exposed orientation, which was moderated by the contribution of learning based on the spontaneous activity. These theoretical results were confirmed by intrinsic optical recordings from area 18 of kittens reared under various visual conditions.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal activity in the early visual cortex has been extensively studied from the standpoint of contour representation. On the other hand, representation of the interior of a surface surrounded by a contour is much less well understood. Several studies have identified neurons activated by a uniform surface covering their receptive fields, but their distribution within the cortex is not yet known. The aim of the present study was to obtain a better understanding of the distribution of such neurons in the visual cortex. Using optical imaging of intrinsic signals, we found that there are a group of surface-responsive regions located in area 18, along the area 17/18 border, that tend to overlap the singular points of the orientation-preference map. Extracellular recordings confirmed that neurons responsive to uniform plane stimuli are accumulated in these regions. Such neurons also existed outside the surface-responsive regions around the singular points. These results suggest that there exists a functional organization related to the representation of a uniform surface in the early visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {It has been reported that the OFF responses of cells in the visual pathway are stronger, on average, than the ON responses early in the life of cats and ferrets. In this study, we theoretically investigate the effects of this imbalance in activity on the orientation map formation. We carry out computer simulations based on our previously proposed self-organization model, in which the correlated activities between ON- and OFF-center cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus regulate the formation of orientation maps in the visual cortex. When imbalance between the activities of these ON- and OFF-center cells is assumed, we obtain orientation maps with spatial periodicity, as observed in the experiments. On the other hand, when balanced activities are assumed, orientation maps do not show periodicity. This suggests that the imbalance in activities between ON- and OFF-center cells contributes to the elaboration of orientation maps during the critical period.},

	Abstract = {Activity-dependent models for cortical simple-cell receptive field development predict specific patterns of correlated neural activity within the visual pathway, such as a Mexican hat-shaped pattern of correlated activity in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). However, such activity patterns have yet to be experimentally demonstrated. We performed multielectrode recordings in the LGN of immature awake ferrets and found simple fall-off-shaped, rather than Mexican hat-shaped, patterns of correlated activity. A weak surround in the LGN neuron's receptive field and the statistics of the input contributed to this pattern of correlated activity. Computer simulation of cortical receptive field development incorporating the experimentally observed activity patterns demonstrated that a simple-cell receptive field emerges when a newly devised 'split' constraint on synaptic growth is combined with Hebbian synaptic modification rules. Thus, given certain developmental constraints on synaptic plasticity, patterns of correlated activity within the LGN are compatible with Hebbian models of simple-cell receptive field development.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the synaptic responses in hippocampal slices to stimulus patterns derived from in vivo recordings of place cell firing in a behaving rodent. We find that synaptic strength is strongly modulated during the presentation of these natural stimulus trains, varying 2-fold or more because of short-term plasticity. This modulation of synaptic strength is precise and deterministic, because the pattern of synaptic response amplitudes is nearly identical from one presentation of the train to the next. The mechanism of synaptic modulation is primarily a change in release probability rather than a change in the size of the elementary postsynaptic response. In addition, natural stimulus trains are effective in inducing long-term potentiation (LTP). We conclude that short-term synaptic plasticity--facilitation, augmentation, and depression--plays a prominent role in normal synaptic function.},

These high-frequency bursts may play a critical role in the functional behavior of hippocampal neurons, but synaptic plasticity at such short times has not been carefully studied. To study synaptic modulation at very short time intervals, we applied pairs of stimuli with interpulse intervals ranging from 7 to 50 msec to CA1 synapses isolated by the method of minimal stimulation in hippocampal slices. We have identified three components of short-term paired-pulse modulation, including (i) a form of synaptic depression manifested after a prior exocytotic event, (ii) a form of synaptic depression that does not depend on a prior exocytotic event and that we postulate is based on inactivation of presynaptic N-type Ca2+ channels, and (iii) a dependence of paired-pulse facilitation on the exocytotic history of the synapse.},

In particular, the amount of paired-pulse facilitation is inversely related to the initial release probability of the synapse. We also examined depletion at individual synapses using high frequency stimulation, and estimated the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool, which averaged 5.0 +/- 3.0 quanta (n = 13 synapses).

One type of Na channel was found. It has a single-channel conductance of 11 pS (15 degrees C) and is blocked by tetrodotoxin. Averaged events show the typical activation and inactivation kinetics of macroscopic Na current. Three potential-dependent K channels were identified (I, F, and S channel). The I channel, being the most frequent type, has a single-channel conductance of 23 pS (inward current, 105 mM K on both sides of the membrane), activates between -60 and -30 mV, deactivates with intermediate kinetics, and is sensitive to dendrotoxin. The F channel has a conductance of 30 pS, activates between -40 and 60 mV, and deactivates with fast kinetics. The former inactivates within tens of seconds; the latter inactivates within seconds. The third type, the S channel, has a conductance of 7 pS and deactivates slowly. All three channels can be blocked by external tetraethylammonium chloride. We suggest that these distinct K channel types form the basis for the different components of macroscopic K current described previously.

	Abstract = {The ion channels responsible for inward rectification in horizontal cells were studied using the patch clamp technique applied to isolated cells from goldfish retina. Inward currents recorded from these cells were identified as due to the opening of inward rectifier channels based on their ion selectivity, channel gating behavior, and the effects of external blocking ions. The single channel conductance was 20 pS in 125 mM external K+. The null current potential shifted with changes in the K+ concentration as expected for a channel permeable to K+, and the channel appeared to have little permeability to Na+. The probability of a channel being in an open state increased as the membrane was hyperpolarized from the K+ equilibrium potential (0 to -10 mV) over potentials ranging to -80 mV, in the presence of external Na+. The closing rate was insensitive to membrane potential in the presence of external Na+. The opening rate of the channel increased as the membrane was hyperpolarized. The increase in the probability of a channel being open at negative potentials was therefore caused by the voltage sensitivity of the rate of channel opening.},

@article{SigworthSpalding1980Nature,
	Abstract = {Tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX) are extremely potent poisons that prevent nerve and muscle cells from producing action potentials by blocking sodium channels. If the channels are modified by reagents that act on carboxyl groups, however, both the binding of these toxins and their effect on the action potential are reduced. One such reagent, trimethyloxonium ion (TMO) converts channels into a form that is not blocked by TTX concentrations 10(5) times greater than its normal Kd (ref. 6). Most such chemical modifications of sodium channels also reduce the measured membrane sodium current, but it has not been known whether such reductions were due to a change in the number of channels, in permeability properties, or in gating properties. We now report that TMO-modified, TTX-resistant sodium channels have a smaller single-channel conductance (gamma) with a more linear instantaneous current-voltage relationship than that of normal channels, and that the measured reduction in gamma accounts for all of the decrease in sodium current after TMO treatment. This change in sodium channel permeability properties can be explained by the removal of a fixed negative charge near the outside of the channel.},

@article{ContiHilleEtAl1976JPhys,
	Abstract = {Single myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta were investigated under voltage clamp conditions at 13 degrees C. Fluctuations of steady-state membrane current were measured during the last 152 msec of 190-225 msec pulses depolarizing the membrane by 8-48 mV. Noise power spectral densities were calculated in the frequency range of 6-6-6757 Hz. 2. External application of 150 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and/or 10 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) ion reduced the current fluctuations. The difference of current noise spectra measured in the presence and absence of TTX (TEA) was not changed by the presence of TEA (TTX) during both measurements, and was taken as the spectrum of the Na (K) current fluctuations. 3. Residual current noise during application of both TTX and TEA was, except for some excess noise at the low and high frequency ends of the spectrum, similar to the noise measured from a passive nerve model and could be understood in terms of Nyquist noise of the known resistances and the amplifier noise. 4. Na current fluctuation spectra were interpreted as the sum N/f+SNa(f) where SNa(F) represents the spectrum expected for a set of equal, independent Na channels with only two conductance states (open or closed) which follow Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics. With values of hinfinity, tauh and minfinity measured from macroscopic Na currents, the measured spectra were fitted well by optimizing N, SNa(0) and taum. Values of taum obtained by this method were in fair agreement with values found from macroscopic currents. 5. The 1/f component of Na current noise was roughly proportional to the square of the steady-state Na current, I2. The mean value of N/I2 was (1-1 +/- 0-3) X 10(-4). 6. The current carried by a single Na channel was calculated from fitted spectra and steady-state Na currents measured simultaneously with the current fluctuations. The single channel conductance gamma normalized to zero absolute membrane potential was calculated. The average gamma from twelve measurements at depolarizations of 8-40 mV was 7-9 +/- 0-9 pS (S.E. of mean). The apparent value of gamma was smallest with small depolarizations. Variations of the assumed kinetic properties of the model did not drastically affect the single channel conductance. 7. External application of 0-1 mM-Ni ion lengthened taum in the macroscopic currents and in the fluctuation spectra and enhanced both the steady-state Na current and the current fluctuations. In Ni-treated nodes gamma was smaller than in normal nodes.

	Abstract = {Conductance-based equations for electrically active cells form one of the most widely studied mathematical frameworks in computational biology. This framework, as expressed through a set of differential equations by Hodgkin and Huxley, synthesizes the impact of ionic currents on a cell's voltage---and the highly nonlinear impact of that voltage back on the currents themselves---into the rapid push and pull of the action potential. Later studies confirmed that these cellular dynamics are orchestrated by individual ion channels, whose conformational changes regulate the conductance of each ionic current. Thus, kinetic equations familiar from physical chemistry are the natural setting for describing conductances; for small-to-moderate numbers of channels, these will predict fluctuations in conductances and stochasticity in the resulting action potentials. At first glance, the kinetic equations provide a far more complex (and higher-dimensional) description than the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations or their counterparts. This has prompted more than a decade of efforts to capture channel fluctuations with noise terms added to the equations of Hodgkin-Huxley type. Many of these approaches, while intuitively appealing, produce quantitative errors when compared to kinetic equations; others, as only very recently demonstrated, are both accurate and relatively simple. We review what works, what doesn't, and why, seeking to build a bridge to well-established results for the deterministic equations of Hodgkin-Huxley type as well as to more modern models of ion channel dynamics. As such, we hope that this review will speed emerging studies of how channel noise modulates electrophysiological dynamics and function. We supply user-friendly {MATLAB} simulation code of these stochastic versions of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations on the {ModelDB} website (accession number 138950) and http://www.amath.washington.edu/{\textasciitilde}etsb/tutorials.html.},

	Abstract = {The muscle I2 is a smooth muscle from the buccal mass of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica whose neural control, in vivo kinematics, and behavioral role have been extensively analyzed. In this study, we measured the activation and contractile dynamics of the muscle in order to construct a Hill-type kinetic model of the muscle. This is the first study to our knowledge, of Aplysia muscle contractile dynamics. The isometric force-frequency relationship of I2 had a frequency threshold of about 6-8 Hz, and its force output saturated at 20-25 Hz, properties that match the high frequency (20 Hz) bursts generated by the {B31/B32} neurons that innervate it. Peak isometric force was generated at about 118\% of the in situ relaxed length. These results and I2's estimated in vivo kinematics suggest that it generates maximum force at the onset of protraction. The muscle tension during iso-velocity lengthening and shortening was an asymmetric function of velocity. Short range stiffness and yielding responses were observed in lengthening, whereas muscle tension decreased smoothly in shortening. These visco-elastic properties suggest that the I2 muscle can serve to brake forceful retraction movements. A Hill-type model, parameterized from the measurements, captured many of the mechanical properties of I2. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the biomechanical significance of the muscle's neural control and provide a basis for simulation studies of the control of feeding behavior.},

	Abstract = {The buccal ganglia of Aplysia contain a central pattern generator (CPG) that organizes the rhythmic movements of the radula and buccal mass during feeding. Many of the cellular and synaptic elements of this CPG have been identified and characterized. However, the roles that specific cellular and synaptic properties play in generating patterns of activity are not well understood. To examine these issues, the present study developed computational models of a portion of this CPG and used simulations to investigate processes underlying the initiation of patterned activity. Simulations were done with the SNNAP software package. The simulated network contained two neurons, B31/B32 and B63. The development of the model was guided and constrained by the available current-clamp data that describe the properties of these two protraction-phase interneurons B31/B32 and B63, which are coupled via electrical and chemical synapses. Several configurations of the model were examined. In one configuration, a fast excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) from B63 to B31/B32 was implemented in combination with an endogenous plateau-like potential in B31/B32. In a second configuration, the excitatory synaptic connection from B63 to B31/B32 produced both fast and slow EPSPs in B31/B32 and the plateau-like potential was removed from B31/B32. Simulations indicated that the former configuration (i.e., electrical and fast chemical coupling in combination with a plateau-like potential) gave rise to a circuit that was robust to changes in parameter values and stochastic fluctuations, that closely mimicked empirical observations, and that was extremely sensitive to inputs controlling the onset of a burst. The coupling between the two simulated neurons served to amplify exogenous depolarizations via a positive feedback loop and the subthreshold activation of the plateau-like potential. Once a burst was initiated, the circuit produced the program in an all-or-none fashion. The slow kinetics of the simulated plateau-like potential played important roles in both initiating and maintaining the burst activity. Thus the present study identified cellular and network properties that contribute to the ability of the simulated network to integrate information over an extended period before a decision is made to initiate a burst of activity and suggests that similar mechanisms may operate in the buccal ganglia in initiating feeding movements.},
