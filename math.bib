	Abstract = {The assessment of the variability of neuronal spike timing is fundamental to gain understanding of latency coding. Based on recent mathematical results, we investigate theoretically the impact of channel noise on latency variability. For large numbers of ion channels, we derive the asymptotic distribution of latency, together with an explicit expression for its variance. Consequences in terms of information processing are studied with Fisher information in the Morris-Lecar model. A competition between sensitivity to input and precision is responsible for favoring two distinct regimes of latencies.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a method for systematically reducing the dimension of biophysically realistic neuron models with stochastic ion channels exploiting time-scales separation. Based on a combination of singular perturbation methods for kinetic Markov schemes with some recent mathematical developments of the averaging method, the techniques are general and applicable to a large class of models. As an example, we derive and analyze reductions of different stochastic versions of the Hodgkin Huxley (HH) model, leading to distinct reduced models. The bifurcation analysis of one of the reduced models with the number of channels as a parameter provides new insights into some features of noisy discharge patterns, such as the bimodality of interspike intervals distribution. Our analysis of the stochastic HH model shows that, besides being a method to reduce the number of variables of neuronal models, our reduction scheme is a powerful method for gaining understanding on the impact of fluctuations due to finite size effects on the dynamics of slow fast systems. Our analysis of the reduced model reveals that decreasing the number of sodium channels in the HH model leads to a transition in the dynamics reminiscent of the Hopf bifurcation and that this transition accounts for changes in characteristics of the spike train generated by the model. Finally, we also examine the impact of these results on neuronal coding, notably, reliability of discharge times and spike latency, showing that reducing the number of channels can enhance discharge time reliability in response to weak inputs and that this phenomenon can be accounted for through the analysis of the reduced model.},

	Abstract = {We study a network of 500 globally-coupled modified van der Pol oscillators. The value of a parameter associated with each oscillator is drawn from a normal distribution, giving a heterogeneous network. For strong enough coupling the oscillators all have the same period, and we consider periodic forcing of the network when it is in this state. By exploiting the correlations that quickly develop between the state of an oscillator and the value of its parameter we obtain an approximate low-dimensional description of the system in terms of the first few coefficients in a polynomial chaos expansion. Standard bifurcation analysis can then be performed on the low-dimensional system which results from this computational coarse-graining, and the results obtained from this predict very well the behaviour of the high-dimensional system for any set of realisations of the random parameter. Situations in which the method begins to fail are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Out-of-phase bursting is a functionally important behavior displayed by central pattern generators and other neural circuits. Understanding this complex activity requires the knowledge of the interplay between the intrinsic cell properties and the properties of synaptic coupling between the cells. Here we describe a simple method that allows us to investigate the existence and stability of anti-phase bursting solutions in a network of two spiking neurons, each possessing a T-type calcium current and coupled by reciprocal inhibition. We derive a one-dimensional map which fully characterizes the genesis and regulation of anti-phase bursting arising from the interaction of the T-current properties with the properties of synaptic inhibition. This map is the burst length return map formed as the composition of two distinct one-dimensional maps that are each regulated by a different set of model parameters. Although each map is constructed using the properties of a single isolated model neuron, the composition of the two maps accurately captures the behavior of the full network. We analyze the parameter sensitivity of these maps to determine the influence of both the intrinsic cell properties and the synaptic properties on the burst length, and to find the conditions under which multistability of several bursting solutions is achieved. Although the derivation of the map relies on a number of simplifying assumptions, we discuss how the principle features of this dimensional reduction method could be extended to more realistic model networks.},

	Abstract = {Establishing, maintaining, and modifying the phase relationships between extensor and flexor muscle groups is essential for central pattern generators in the spinal cord to coordinate the hindlimbs well enough to produce the basic walking rhythm. This paper investigates a simplified computational model for the spinal hindlimb central pattern generator (CPG) that is abstracted from experimental data from the rodent spinal cord. This model produces locomotor-like activity with appropriate phase relationships in which right and left muscle groups alternate while extensor and flexor muscle groups alternate. Convergence to this locomotor pattern is slow, however, and the range of parameter values for which the model produces appropriate output is relatively narrow. We examine these aspects of the model's coordination of left-right activity through investigation of successively more complicated subnetworks, focusing on the role of the synaptic architecture in shaping motoneuron phasing. We find unexpected sensitivity in the phase response properties of individual neurons in response to stimulation and a need for high levels of both inhibition and excitation to achieve the walking rhythm. In the absence of cross-cord excitation, equal levels of ipsilateral and contralateral inhibition result in a strong preference for hopping over walking. Inhibition alone can produce the walking rhythm, but contralateral inhibition must be much stronger than ipsilateral inhibition. Cross-cord excitatory connections significantly enhance convergence to the walking rhythm, which is achieved most rapidly with strong crossed excitation and greater contralateral than ipsilateral inhibition. We discuss the implications of these results for CPG architectures based on unit burst generators.},

It is predicated on the assumption that the perturbations in question are "sufficiently weak", an assumption that is not always valid when perturbative methods are applied. In this paper, we identify a number of concrete dynamical scenarios in which a standard perturbative technique, based on the infinitesimal phase response curve (PRC), is shown to give different predictions than the full model. Shear-induced chaos, i.e., chaotic behavior that results from the amplification of small perturbations by underlying shear, is missed entirely by the PRC. We show also that the presence of "sticky" phase-space structures tend to cause perturbative techniques to overestimate the frequencies and regularity of the oscillations. The phenomena we describe can all be observed in a simple 2D neuron model, which we choose for illustration as the PRC is widely used in mathematical neuroscience.}},

	Abstract = {We develop geometric dynamical systems methods to determine how various components contribute to a neuronal network's emergent population behaviors. The results clarify the multiple roles inhibition can play in producing different rhythms. Which rhythms arise depends on how inhibition interacts with intrinsic properties of the neurons; the nature of these interactions depends on the underlying architecture of the network. Our analysis demonstrates that fast inhibitory coupling may lead to synchronized rhythms if either the cells within the network or the architecture of the network is sufficiently complicated. This cannot occur in mutually coupled networks with basic cells; the geometric approach helps explain how additional network complexity allows for synchronized rhythms in the presence of fast inhibitory coupling. The networks and issues considered are motivated by recent models for thalamic oscillations. The analysis helps clarify the roles of various biophysical features, such as fast and slow inhibition, cortical inputs, and ionic conductances, in producing network behavior associated with the spindle sleep rhythm and with paroxysmal discharge rhythms. Transitions between these rhythms are also discussed.},

Under some additional non-degeneracy assumption, we show that in such a situation: (i) To each metastable point corresponds a metastable state, whose mean exit time can be computed precisely. (ii) To each metastable point corresponds one simple eigenvalue of 1 â P N which is essentially equal to the inverse mean exit time from this state. Moreover, these results imply very sharp uniform control of the deviation of the probability distribution of metastable exit times from the exponential distribution.},

We use singular perturbation methods and averaging to show that this is a general property of Type I membrane models.

We also show the differences between synapses that act rapidly and those that act slowly and derive a canonical form for the phase interactions.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the firing rate of the quadratic integrate-and-fire neuron in response to a colored noise input current. Such an input current is a good approximation to the noise due to the random bombardment of spikes, with the correlation time of the noise corresponding to the decay time of the synapses. The key parameter that determines the firing rate is the ratio of the correlation time of the colored noise, tau(s), to the neuronal time constant, tau(m). We calculate the firing rate exactly in two limits: when the ratio, tau(s)/tau(m), goes to zero (white noise) and when it goes to infinity. The correction to the short correlation time limit is O(tau(s)/tau(m)), which is qualita tively different from that of the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, where the correction is O( radical tau(s)/tau(m)). The difference is due to the different boundary conditions of the probability density function of the membrane potential of the neuron at firing threshold. The correction to the long correlation time limit is O(tau(m)/tau(s)). By combining the short and long correlation time limits, we derive an expression that provides a good approximation to the firing rate over the whole range of tau(s)/tau(m) in the suprathreshold regime-that is, in a regime in which the average current is sufficient to make the cell fire. In the subthreshold regime, the expression breaks down somewhat when tau(s) becomes large compared to tau(m).},

	Abstract = {{Neuronal avalanches are a form of spontaneous activity widely observed in cortical slices and other types of nervous tissue, both in vivo and in vitro. They are characterized by irregular, isolated population bursts when many neurons fire together, where the number of spikes per burst obeys a power law distribution. We simulate, using the Gillespie algorithm, a model of neuronal avalanches based on stochastic single neurons. The network consists of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, first with all-to-all connectivity and later with random sparse connectivity. Analyzing our model using the system size expansion, we show that the model obeys the standard Wilson-Cowan equations for large network sizes ( neurons). When excitation and inhibition are closely balanced, networks of thousands of neurons exhibit irregular synchronous activity, including the characteristic power law distribution of avalanche size. We show that these avalanches are due to the balanced network having weakly stable functionally feedforward dynamics, which amplifies some small fluctuations into the large population bursts. Balanced networks are thought to underlie a variety of observed network behaviours and have useful computational properties, such as responding quickly to changes in input. Thus, the appearance of avalanches in such functionally feedforward networks indicates that avalanches may be a simple consequence of a widely present network structure, when neuron dynamics are noisy. An important implication is that a network need not be "critical" for the production of avalanches, so experimentally observed power laws in burst size may be a signature of noisy functionally feedforward structure rather than of, for example, self-organized criticality.}},

	Abstract = {In the cat or primate primary visual cortex (V1), normal vision corresponds to a state where neural excitation patterns are driven by external visual stimuli. A spectacular failure mode of V1 occurs when such patterns are overwhelmed by spontaneously generated spatially self-organized patterns of neural excitation. These are experienced as geometric visual hallucinations. The problem of identifying the mechanisms by which V1 avoids this failure is made acute by recent advances in the statistical mechanics of pattern formation, which suggest that the hallucinatory state should be very robust. Here, we report how incorporating physiologically realistic long-range connections between inhibitory neurons changes the behavior of a model of V1. We find that the sparsity of long-range inhibition in V1 plays a previously unrecognized but key functional role in preserving the normal vision state. Surprisingly, it also contributes to the observed regularity of geometric visual hallucinations. Our results provide an explanation for the observed sparsity of long-range inhibition in V1--this generic architectural feature is an evolutionary adaptation that tunes V1 to the normal vision state. In addition, it has been shown that exactly the same long-range connections play a key role in the development of orientation preference maps. Thus V1's most striking long-range features--patchy excitatory connections and sparse inhibitory connections--are strongly constrained by two requirements: the need for the visual state to be robust and the developmental requirements of the orientational preference map.},

	Abstract = {Networks of neurons produce diverse patterns of oscillations, arising from the network's global properties, the propensity of individual neurons to oscillate, or a mixture of the two. Here we describe noisy limit cycles and quasi-cycles, two related mechanisms underlying emergent oscillations in neuronal networks whose individual components, stochastic spiking neurons, do not themselves oscillate. Both mechanisms are shown to produce gamma band oscillations at the population level while individual neurons fire at a rate much lower than the population frequency. Spike trains in a network undergoing noisy limit cycles display a preferred period which is not found in the case of quasi-cycles, due to the even faster decay of phase information in quasi-cycles. These oscillations persist in sparsely connected networks, and variation of the network's connectivity results in variation of the oscillation frequency. A network of such neurons behaves as a stochastic perturbation of the deterministic Wilson-Cowan equations, and the network undergoes noisy limit cycles or quasi-cycles depending on whether these have limit cycles or a weakly stable focus. These mechanisms provide a new perspective on the emergence of rhythmic firing in neural networks, showing the coexistence of population-level oscillations with very irregular individual spike trains in a simple and general framework.},

	Abstract = {Population rate or activity equations are the foundation of a common approach to modeling for neural networks. These equations provide mean field dynamics for the firing rate or activity of neurons within a network given some connectivity. The shortcoming of these equations is that they take into account only the average firing rate, while leaving out higher-order statistics like correlations between firing. A stochastic theory of neural networks that includes statistics at all orders was recently formulated. We describe how this theory yields a systematic extension to population rate equations by introducing equations for correlations and appropriate coupling terms. Each level of the approximation yields closed equations; they depend only on the mean and specific correlations of interest, without an ad hoc criterion for doing so. We show in an example of an all-to-all connected network how our system of generalized activity equations captures phenomena missed by the mean field rate equations alone.},

	Abstract = {{We analyze neocortical dynamics using field theoretic methods for non-equilibrium statistical processes. Assuming the dynamics is Markovian, we introduce a model that describes both neural fluctuations and responses to stimuli. We show that at low spiking rates, neocortical activity exhibits a dynamical phase transition which is in the universality class of directed percolation (DP). Because of the high density and large spatial extent of neural interactions, there is a "mean field" region in which the effects of fluctuations are negligible. However as the generation and decay of spiking activity becomes balanced, there is a crossover into the critical fluctuation driven DP region, consistent with measurements in neocortical slice preparations. From the perspective of theoretical neuroscience, the principal contribution of this work is the formulation of a theory of neural activity that goes beyond the mean-field approximation and incorporates the effects of fluctuations and correlations in the critical region. This theory shows that the scaling laws found in many measurements of neocortical activity, in anesthetized, normal and epileptic neocortex, are consistent with the existence of DP and related phase transitions at a critical point. It also shows how such properties lead to a model of the origins of both random and rhythmic brain activity.}},

	Abstract = {A well-defined stochastic theory for neural activity, which permits the calculation of arbitrary statistical moments and equations governing them, is a potentially valuable tool for theoretical neuroscience. We produce such a theory by analyzing the dynamics of neural activity using field theoretic methods for nonequilibrium statistical processes. Assuming that neural network activity is Markovian, we construct the effective spike model, which describes both neural fluctuations and response. This analysis leads to a systematic expansion of corrections to mean field theory, which for the effective spike model is a simple version of the Wilson-Cowan equation. We argue that neural activity governed by this model exhibits a dynamical phase transition which is in the universality class of directed percolation. More general models (which may incorporate refractoriness) can exhibit other universality classes, such as dynamic isotropic percolation. Because of the extremely high connectivity in typical networks, it is expected that higher-order terms in the systematic expansion are small for experimentally accessible measurements, and thus, consistent with measurements in neocortical slice preparations, we expect mean field exponents for the transition. We provide a quantitative criterion for the relative magnitude of each term in the systematic expansion, analogous to the Ginsburg criterion. Experimental identification of dynamic universality classes in vivo is an outstanding and important question for neuroscience.},

In the thermodynamic limit Nââ , where N determines the size of each population, the dynamics is described by deterministic Wilson-Cowan equations. On the other hand, for finite N the dynamics is described by a master equation that determines the probability of spiking activity within each population. We first consider a single excitatory population that exhibits bistability in the deterministic limit. The steady-state probability distribution of the stochastic network has maxima at points corresponding to the stable fixed points of the deterministic network; the relative weighting of the two maxima depends on the system size. For large but finite N , we calculate the exponentially small rate of noise-induced transitions between the resulting metastable states using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation and matched asymptotic expansions. We then consider a two-population excitatory or inhibitory network that supports limit cycle oscillations. Using a diffusion approximation, we reduce the dynamics to a neural Langevin equation, and show how the intrinsic noise amplifies subthreshold oscillations (quasicycles).},

	Abstract = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.},

	Abstract = {A stochastic interpretation of spontaneous action potential initiation is developed for the Morris-Lecar equations. Initiation of a spontaneous action potential can be interpreted as the escape from one of the wells of a double well potential, and we develop an asymptotic approximation of the mean exit time using a recently developed quasistationary perturbation method. Using the fact that the activating ionic channel's random openings and closings are fast relative to other processes, we derive an accurate estimate for the mean time to fire an action potential (MFT), which is valid for a below-threshold applied current. Previous studies have found that for above-threshold applied current, where there is only a single stable fixed point, a diffusion approximation can be used. We also explore why different diffusion approximation techniques fail to estimate the MFT.},

	Abstract = {The phenomenon of slow switching in populations of globally coupled oscillators is discussed. This characteristic collective dynamics, which was first discovered in a particular class of the phase oscillator model, is a result of the formation of a heteroclinic loop connecting a pair of clustered states of the population. We argue that the same behavior can arise in a wider class of oscillator models with the amplitude degree of freedom. We also argue how such heteroclinic loops arise inevitably and persist robustly in a homogeneous population of globally coupled oscillators. Although a heteroclinic loop might seem to arise only exceptionally, we find that it appears rather easily by introducing time delay into a population which would otherwise exhibit perfect phase synchrony. We argue that the appearance of the heteroclinic loop induced by the delayed coupling is then characterized by transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations. Slow switching arises when a system with a heteroclinic loop is weakly perturbed. This will be demonstrated with a vector model by applying weak noises. Other types of weak symmetry-breaking perturbations can also cause slow switching.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal networks exhibit a variety of complex spatiotemporal patterns that include sequential activity, synchrony, and wavelike dynamics. Inhibition is the primary means through which such patterns are implemented. This behavior is dependent on both the intrinsic dynamics of the individual neurons as well as the connectivity patterns. Many neural circuits consist of networks of smaller subcircuits (motifs) that are coupled together to form the larger system. In this paper, we consider a particularly simple motif, comprising purely inhibitory interactions, which generates sequential periodic dynamics. We first describe the dynamics of the single motif both for general balanced coupling (all cells receive the same number and strength of inputs) and then for a specific class of balanced networks: circulant systems. We couple these motifs together to form larger networks. We use the theory of weak coupling to derive phase models which, themselves, have a certain structure and symmetry. We show that this structure endows the coupled system with the ability to produce arbitrary timing relationships between symmetrically coupled motifs and that the phase relationships are robust over a wide range of frequencies. The theory is applicable to many other systems in biology and physics.},

	Abstract = {The interaction of a pair of weakly coupled biological bursters is examined.Bursting refers to oscillations in which an observable slowly alternates between phases of relative quiescence and rapid oscillatory behavior. The motivation for this work is to understand the role of electrical coupling in promoting the synchronization of bursting electrical activity (BEA) observed in the -cells of the islet of Langerhans, which secrete insulin in response to glucose. By studying the coupled fast subsystem of a model of BEA, we focus on the interaction that occurs during the rapid oscillatory phase. Coupling is weak, diffusive and non-scalar. In addition,non-identical oscillators are permitted. Using perturbation methods with the assumption that the uncoupled oscillators are near a Hopf bifurcation, a reduced system of equations is obtained. A detailed bifurcation study of this reduced system reveals a variety of patterns but suggests that asymmetrically phase-locked solutions are the most typical. Finally, the results are applied to the unreduced full bursting system and used to predict the burst pattern for a pair of cells with a given coupling strength and degree of heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT This paper describes a previously undocumented phenomenon in dynamical systems theory; namely, the occurrence of heteroclinic cycles that are structurally stable within the space of Cr vector fields equivariant with respect to a symmetry group. In the space X(M) of Cr vector fields on a manifold M, there is a residual set of vector fields having no trajectories joining saddle points with stable manifolds of the same dimension. Such heteroclinic connections are a structurally unstable phenomenon [4]. However, in the space XG(M) â X(M) of vector fields equivariant with respect to a symmetry group G, the situation can be quite different. We give an example of an open set U of topologically equivalent vector fields in the space of vector fields on 3 equivariant with respect to a particular finite subgroup G â O(3) such that each X  U has a heteroclinic cycle that is an attractor. The heteroclinic cycles consist of three equilibrium points and three trajectories joining them. },

We show that this applies to certain models of potassium channels, sodium channels, ryanodine receptors and IP(3) receptors. We also use this to show that the original Hodgkin-Huxley formulations of potassium channel conductance and sodium channel conductance are the exact solutions of full Markov models for these channels.},

	Abstract = {Some new insight is obtained for the structure of the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol system. The problems of excitability and threshold are discussed for all three types of the system classified according to the existing attractors: a focus only, a limit cycle only and a limit cycle together with a focus. These problems can be treated by the T-repellers and the T-attractors of the system which are mutually reciprocal under time inversion. The threshold depends on the structure of the T-repeller (unstable part of integral manifold). This structure is then used to understand the behavior and the properties of the two different types of isochrones: Winfree isochrones (W-isochrones) and regular isochrones. Winfree's description of a W-isochrone is extended to excitable systems. Both W-isochrones and regular isochrones are calculated for the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol system in its limit cycle and excitable regimes. The important role of the T-repeller as an asymptotic limit for both types of isochrones is manifested. (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {The response of an excitable neuron to trains of electrical spikes is relevant to the understanding of the neural code. In this paper, we study a neurobiologically motivated relaxation oscillator, with appropriately identified fast and slow coordinates, that admits an explicit mathematical analysis. An application of geometric singular perturbation theory shows the existence of an attracting invariant manifold, which is used to construct the Fenichel normal form for the system. This facilitates the calculation of the response of the system to pulsatile stimulation and allows the construction of a so-called extended isochronal map. The isochronal map is shown to have a single discontinuity and be of a type that can admit three types of response: mode-locked, quasiperiodic, and chaotic. The bifurcation structure of the system is seen to be extremely rich and supports period-adding bifurcations separated by windows of both chaos and periodicity. A bifurcation analysis of the isochronal map is presented in conjunction with a description of the various routes to chaos in this system.},

Much of this activity is spontaneous - uncoupled to overt stimuli or motor outputs - leading to questions about the functional impact of this noise. Although noise is most often thought of as disrupting patterned activity and interfering with the encoding of stimuli, recent theoretical and experimental work has shown that noise can play a constructive role - leading to increased reliability or regularity of neuronal firing in single neurons and across populations. These results raise fundamental questions about how noise can influence neural function and computation.},

We apply methods from stochastic nonlinear dynamics to coupled noisy phase-resetting maps and obtain the invariant density of phase distributions. By exploiting the special structure of PRCs, we obtain some approximations for the invariant distributions. Comparisons to Monte-Carlo simulations are made.

	Abstract = {Are there general principles for pattern generation? We examined this question by analyzing the operation of large populations of evolved model central pattern generators (CPGs) for walking. Three populations of model CPGs were evolved, containing three, four, or five neurons. We identified six general principles. First, locomotion performance increased with the number of interneurons. Second, the top 10 three-, four-, and five-neuron CPGs could be decomposed into dynamical modules, an abstract description developed in a companion article. Third, these dynamical modules were multistable: they could be switched between multiple stable output configurations. Fourth, the rhythmic pattern generated by a CPG could be understood as a closed chain of successive destabilizations of one dynamical module by another. A combinatorial analysis enumerated the possible dynamical modular structures. Fifth, one-dimensional modules were frequently observed and, in some cases, could be assigned specific functional roles. Finally, dynamic dynamical modules, in which the modular structure itself changed over one cycle, were frequently observed. The existence of these general principles despite significant variability in both patterns of connectivity and neural parameters was explained by degeneracy in the maps from neural parameters to neural dynamics to behavior to fitness. An analysis of the biomechanical properties of the model body was essential for relating neural activity to behavior. Our studies of evolved model circuits suggest that, in the absence of other constraints, there is no compelling reason to expect neural circuits to be functionally decomposable as the number of interneurons increase. Analyzing idealized model pattern generators may be an effective methodology for gaining insights into the operation of biological pattern generators.},

We explored this question by examining the dynamics of a model central pattern generator that was created using an evolutionary algorithm. We propose an abstract description based on the concept of a dynamical module, a set of neurons that simultaneously make their transitions from one quasistable state to another while the synaptic inputs that they receive from other neurons remain essentially constant, thus temporarily reducing the dimensionality of the circuit dynamics. Using the mathematical tools of dynamical systems theory, we describe a method for identifying dynamical modules and demonstrate that this concept can be used to quantitatively characterize constraints on neural architecture, account for phase durations, and predict the effects of parameter changes. Moreover, this abstract description reveals coordinated parameter changes that leave the overall circuit dynamics essentially unchanged. In a companion article we employ this abstract description to examine the relationship between general principles and individual variability in large populations of evolved model pattern generators.},

We then use the symmetry of the circular array (and bifurcation from an invariant equilibrium) to identify symmetric solutions of the circular array that restrict to solutions of the original linear array. We apply these abstract results to a system of coupled Brusselators to prove that patterned solutions exist. In addition, we show, in certain instances, that these patterned solutions can be found by numerical integration and hence are presumably asymptotically stable.},

	Abstract = {Animal locomotion is controlled, in part, by a central pattern generator (CPG), which is an intraspinal network of neurons capable of generating a rhythmic output. The spatio-temporal symmetries of the quadrupedal gaits walk, trot and pace lead to plausible assumptions about the symmetries of locomotor CPGs. These assumptions imply that the CPG of a quadruped should consist of eight nominally identical subcircuits, arranged in an essentially unique matter. Here we apply analogous arguments to myriapod CPGs. Analyses based on symmetry applied to these networks lead to testable predictions, including a distinction between primary and secondary gaits, the existence of a new primary gait called 'jump', and the occurrence of half-integer wave numbers in myriapod gaits. For bipeds, our analysis also predicts two gaits with the out-of-phase symmetry of the walk and two gaits with the in-phase symmetry of the hop. We present data that support each of these predictions. This work suggests that symmetry can be used to infer a plausible class of CPG network architectures from observed patterns of animal gaits.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we continue the analysis of a network of symmetrically coupled cells modeling central pattern generators for quadruped locomotion proposed by Golubitsky, Stewart, Buono, and Collins. By a cell we mean a system of ordinary differential equations and by a coupled cell system we mean a network of identical cells with coupling terms. We have three main results in this paper. First, we show that the proposed network is the simplest one modeling the common quadruped gaits of walk, trot, and pace. In doing so we prove a general theorem classifying spatio-temporal symmetries of periodic solutions to equivariant systems of differential equations. We also specialize this theorem to coupled cell systems. Second, this paper focuses on primary gaits; that is, gaits that are modeled by output signals from the central pattern generator where each cell emits the same waveform along with exact phase shifts between cells. Our previous work showed that the network is capable of producing six primary gaits. Here, we show that under mild assumptions on the cells and the coupling of the network, primary gaits can be produced from Hopf bifurcation by varying only coupling strengths of the network. Third, we discuss the stability of primary gaits and exhibit these solutions by performing numerical simulations using the dimensionless Morris-Lecar equations for the cell dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Golubitsky, Stewart, Buono and Collins proposed two models for the achitecture of central pattern generators (CPGs): one for bipeds (which we call leg) and one for quadrupeds (which we call quad). In this paper we use symmetry techniques to classify the possible spatiotemporal symmetries of periodic solutions that can exist in leg (there are 10 nontrivial types) and we explore the possibility that coordinated arm/leg rhythms can be understood, on the CPG level, by a small breaking of the symmetry in quad, which leads to a third CPG architecture arm. Rhythms produced by leg correspond to the bipedal gaits of walk, run, two-legged hop, two-legged jump, skip, gallop, asymmetric hop, and one-legged hop. We show that breaking the symmetry between fore and hind limbs in quad, which yields the CPG arm, leads to periodic solution types whose associated leg rhythms correspond to seven of the eight leg gaits found in leg; the missing biped gait is the asymmetric hop. However, when arm/leg coordination rhythms are considered, we find the correct rhythms only for the biped gaits of two-legged hop, run, and gallop. In particular, the biped gait walk, along with its arm rhythms, cannot be obtained by a small breaking of symmetry of any quadruped gait supported by quad.},

We have formulated a dynamical model of the chaotic hunting behavior of Clione based on physiological in vivo and in vitro experiments. The model includes a description of the action of the cerebral hunting interneuron on the receptor neurons of the gravity sensory organ, the statocyst. A network of six receptor model neurons with Lotka-Volterra-type dynamics and nonsymmetric inhibitory interactions has no simple static attractors that correspond to winner take all phenomena. Instead, the winnerless competition induced by the hunting neuron displays hyperchaos with two positive Lyapunov exponents. The origin of the chaos is related to the interaction of two clusters of receptor neurons that are described with two heteroclinic loops in phase space. We hypothesize that the chaotic activity of the receptor neurons can drive the complex behavior of Clione observed during hunting. (c) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Emotion (i.e., spontaneous motivation and subsequent implementation of a behavior) and cognition (i.e., problem solving by information processing) are essential to how we, as humans, respond to changes in our environment. Recent studies in cognitive science suggest that emotion and cognition are subserved by different, although heavily integrated, neural systems. Understanding the time-varying relationship of emotion and cognition is a challenging goal with important implications for neuroscience. We formulate here the dynamical model of emotion-cognition interaction that is based on the following principles: (1) the temporal evolution of cognitive and emotion modes are captured by the incoming stimuli and competition within and among themselves (competition principle); (2) metastable states exist in the unified emotion-cognition phase space; and (3) the brain processes information with robust and reproducible transients through the sequence of metastable states. Such a model can take advantage of the often ignored temporal structure of the emotion-cognition interaction to provide a robust and generalizable method for understanding the relationship between brain activation and complex human behavior. The mathematical image of the robust and reproducible transient dynamics is a Stable Heteroclinic Sequence (SHS), and the Stable Heteroclinic Channels (SHCs). These have been hypothesized to be possible mechanisms that lead to the sequential transient behavior observed in networks. We investigate the modularity of SHCs, i.e., given a SHS and a SHC that is supported in one part of a network, we study conditions under which the SHC pertaining to the cognition will continue to function in the presence of interfering activity with other parts of the network, i.e., emotion.},

	Abstract = {Robustness and reproducibility of sequential spatio-temporal responses is an essential feature of many neural circuits in sensory and motor systems of animals. The most common mathematical images of dynamical regimes in neural systems are fixed points, limit cycles, chaotic attractors, and continuous attractors (attractive manifolds of neutrally stable fixed points). These are not suitable for the description of reproducible transient sequential neural dynamics. In this paper we present the concept of a stable heteroclinic sequence (SHS), which is not an attractor. SHS opens the way for understanding and modeling of transient sequential activity in neural circuits. We show that this new mathematical object can be used to describe robust and reproducible sequential neural dynamics. Using the framework of a generalized high-dimensional Lotka-Volterra model, that describes the dynamics of firing rates in an inhibitory network, we present analytical results on the existence of the SHS in the phase space of the network. With the help of numerical simulations we confirm its robustness in presence of noise in spite of the transient nature of the corresponding trajectories. Finally, by referring to several recent neurobiological experiments, we discuss possible applications of this new concept to several problems in neuroscience.},

A key quantity of such networks is the number of basins of attraction in the state space. The number of basins of attraction changes as a function of the size of the network, its connectivity and its transition rules. In discrete networks, a simple count of the number of attractors does not reveal the combinatorial structure of the attractors. These points are illustrated in a reexamination of dynamics in a class of random Boolean networks considered previously by Kauffman. We also consider comparisons between dynamics in discrete networks and continuous analogues. A continuous analogue of a discrete network may have a different number of attractors for many different reasons. Some attractors in discrete networks may be associated with unstable dynamics, and several different attractors in a discrete network may be associated with a single attractor in the continuous case. Special problems in determining attractors in continuous systems arise when there is aperiodic dynamics associated with quasiperiodicity of deterministic chaos.},

@article{Edwards+Glass:2000:Chaos,
	Abstract = {The explosive growth in knowledge of the genome of humans and other organisms leaves open the question of how the functioning of genes in interacting networks is coordinated for orderly activity. One approach to this problem is to study mathematical properties of abstract network models that capture the logical structures of gene networks. The principal issue is to understand how particular patterns of activity can result from particular network structures, and what types of behavior are possible. We study idealized models in which the logical structure of the network is explicitly represented by Boolean functions that can be represented by directed graphs on n-cubes, but which are continuous in time and described by differential equations, rather than being updated synchronously via a discrete clock. The equations are piecewise linear, which allows significant analysis and facilitates rapid integration along trajectories. We first give a combinatorial solution to the question of how many distinct logical structures exist for n-dimensional networks, showing that the number increases very rapidly with n. We then outline analytic methods that can be used to establish the existence, stability and periods of periodic orbits corresponding to particular cycles on the n-cube. We use these methods to confirm the existence of limit cycles discovered in a sample of a million randomly generated structures of networks of 4 genes. Even with only 4 genes, at least several hundred different patterns of stable periodic behavior are possible, many of them surprisingly complex. We discuss ways of further classifying these periodic behaviors, showing that small mutations (reversal of one or a few edges on the n-cube) need not destroy the stability of a limit cycle. Although these networks are very simple as models of gene networks, their mathematical transparency reveals relationships between structure and behavior, they suggest that the possibilities for orderly dynamics in such networks are extremely rich and they offer novel ways to think about how mutations can alter dynamics.

If the time between two consecutive "weak" stimuli is sufficiently short, the effects produced by the pair of stimuli may be characteristic of a single "strong" stimulus.

	Abstract = {Sensory input plays a major role in controlling motor responses during most behavioral tasks. The vestibular organs in the marine mollusk Clione, the statocysts, react to the external environment and continuously adjust the tail and wing motor neurons to keep the animal oriented vertically. However, we suggested previously that during hunting behavior, the intrinsic dynamics of the statocyst network produce a spatiotemporal pattern that may control the motor system independently of environmental cues. Once the response is triggered externally, the collective activation of the statocyst neurons produces a complex sequential signal. In the behavioral context of hunting, such network dynamics may be the main determinant of an intricate spatial behavior. Here, we show that (1) during fictive hunting, the population activity of the statocyst receptors is correlated positively with wing and tail motor output suggesting causality, (2) that fictive hunting can be evoked by electrical stimulation of the statocyst network, and (3) that removal of even a few individual statocyst receptors critically changes the fictive hunting motor pattern. These results indicate that the intrinsic dynamics of a sensory network, even without its normal cues, can organize a motor program vital for the survival of the animal.},

	Abstract = {According to the traditional view of synchronization, a weak periodic input is able to lock a nonlinear oscillator at a frequency close to that of the input (1:1 zone). If the forcing increases, it is possible to achieve synchronization at subharmonic bands also. Using a competitive dynamical system we show the inverse phenomenon: with a weak signal the 1:1 zone is narrow, but the synchronization of ultrasubharmonics is dominant. In the system's phase space, there exists a heteroclinic contour in the autonomous regime, which is the image of sequential dynamics. Under the action of a weak periodic forcing, in the vicinity of the contour a stable limit cycle with long period appears. This results in the locking of very low-frequency oscillations with the finite frequency of the forcing. We hypothesize that this phenomenon can be the origin for the synchronization of slow and fast brain rhythms.},

Analysis of these phenomena is based on the winnerless competition principle. The considered models can be a basis for the design of biologically inspired autonomous intelligent systems.},

To do it we introduce a new class of dynamical models that are described by ordinary differential equations with a finite number of possibilities at the decision points, and also include rules solving this uncertainty. Our approach is based on the competition between possible cognitive states using their stable transient dynamics. The model controls the order of choosing successive steps of a sequential activity according to the environment and decision-making criteria. Two strategies (high-risk and risk-aversion conditions) that move the system out of an erratic environment are analyzed.},

	Abstract = {The idea that cognitive activity can be understood using nonlinear dynamics has been intensively discussed at length for the last 15 years. One of the popular points of view is that metastable states play a key role in the execution of cognitive functions. Experimental and modeling studies suggest that most of these functions are the result of transient activity of large-scale brain networks in the presence of noise. Such transients may consist of a sequential switching between different metastable cognitive states. The main problem faced when using dynamical theory to describe transient cognitive processes is the fundamental contradiction between reproducibility and flexibility of transient behavior. In this paper, we propose a theoretical description of transient cognitive dynamics based on the interaction of functionally dependent metastable cognitive states. The mathematical image of such transient activity is a stable heteroclinic channel, i.e., a set of trajectories in the vicinity of a heteroclinic skeleton that consists of saddles and unstable separatrices that connect their surroundings. We suggest a basic mathematical model, a strongly dissipative dynamical system, and formulate the conditions for the robustness and reproducibility of cognitive transients that satisfy the competing requirements for stability and flexibility. Based on this approach, we describe here an effective solution for the problem of sequential decision making, represented as a fixed time game: a player takes sequential actions in a changing noisy environment so as to maximize a cumulative reward. As we predict and verify in computer simulations, noise plays an important role in optimizing the gain.},

@article{Ivanchenko:2008uq,
	Abstract = {The origin of rhythmic activity in brain circuits and CPG-like motor networks is still not fully understood. The main unsolved questions are (i) What are the respective roles of intrinsic bursting and network based dynamics in systems of coupled heterogeneous, intrinsically complex, even chaotic, neurons? (ii) What are the mechanisms underlying the coexistence of robustness and flexibility in the observed rhythmic spatio-temporal patterns? One common view is that particular bursting neurons provide the rhythmogenic component while the connections between different neurons are responsible for the regularisation and synchronisation of groups of neurons and for specific phase relationships in multi-phasic patterns. We have examined the spatio-temporal rhythmic patterns in computer-simulated motif networks of H-H neurons connected by slow inhibitory synapses with a non-symmetric pattern of coupling strengths. We demonstrate that the interplay between intrinsic and network dynamics features either cooperation or competition, depending on three basic control parameters identified in our model: the shape of intrinsic bursts, the strength of the coupling and its degree of asymmetry. The cooperation of intrinsic dynamics and network mechanisms is shown to correlate with bistability, i.e., the coexistence of two different attractors in the phase space of the system corresponding to different rhythmic spatio-temporal patterns. Conversely, if the network mechanism of rhythmogenesis dominates, monostability is observed with a typical pattern of winnerless competition between neurons. We analyse bifurcations between the two regimes and demonstrate how they provide robustness and flexibility to the network performance.},

A sufficiently complex model with the necessary predicting power requires solutions that are structurally stable. Small variations of the system parameters should not qualitatively perturb its solutions. When one is interested in just asymptotic results of evolution (as time goes to infinity), then the problem has a straightforward mathematical image involving simple attractors (fixed points or limit cycles) of a dynamical system. However, for an accurate prediction of evolution, the analysis of transient solutions is critical. In this paper, in the framework of the traditional Lotka-Volterra model (generalized in some sense), we show that the transient solution representing multispecies sequential competition can be reproducible and predictable with high probability.},

	Abstract = {Bifurcation mechanisms involved in the generation of action potentials (spikes) by neurons are reviewed here. We show how the type of bifurcation determines the neuro-computational properties of the cells. For example, when the rest state is near a saddle-node bifurcation, the cell can fire all-or-none spikes with an arbitrary low frequency, it has a well-defined threshold manifold, and it acts as an integrator; i.e. the higher the frequency of incoming pulses, the sooner it fires. In contrast, when the rest state is near an {Andronov--Hopf} bifurcation, the cell fires in a certain frequency range, its spikes are not all-or-none, it does not have a well-defined threshold manifold, it can fire in response to an inhibitory pulse, and it acts as a resonator; i.e. it responds preferentially to a certain (resonant) frequency of the input. Increasing the input frequency may actually delay or terminate its firing.

We also describe the phenomenon of neural bursting, and we use geometric bifurcation theory to extend the existing classification of bursters, including many new types. We discuss how the type of burster defines its neuro-computational properties, and we show that different bursters can interact, synchronize and process information differently.},

	Abstract = {{Synchronous rhythmic spiking in neuronal networks can be brought about by the interaction between E-cells and Icells (excitatory and inhibitory cells). The I-cells gate and synchronize the E-cells, and the E-cells drive and synchronize the I-cells. We refer to rhythms generated in this way as PING (pyramidal-interneuronal gamma) rhythms. The PING mechanism requires that the drive I(I) to the I-cells be sufficiently low; the rhythm is lost when I(I) gets too large. This can happen in at least two ways. In the first mechanism, the I-cells spike in synchrony, but get ahead of the E-cells, spiking without being prompted by the E-cells. We call this phase walkthrough of the I-cells. In the second mechanism, the I-cells fail to synchronize, and their activity leads to complete suppression of the E-cells. Noisy spiking in the E-cells, generated by noisy external drive, adds excitatory drive to the I-cells and may lead to phase walkthrough. Noisy spiking in the I-cells adds inhibition to the E-cells and may lead to suppression of the E-cells. An analysis of the conditions under which noise leads to phase walkthrough of the I-cells or suppression of the E-cells shows that PING rhythms at frequencies far below the gamma range are robust to noise only if network parameter values are tuned very carefully. Together with an argument explaining why the PING mechanism does not work far above the gamma range in the presence of heterogeneity, this justifies the "G" in "PING."}},

	Abstract = {Electrophysiological properties of spiking neurons receiving complex stimuli perturbed by noise are investigated. A semi-analytical estimate of firing probabilities and subthreshold behavior of the stochastic system can be made in terms of the solution of a purely deterministic system. The method comes from an approximation for the distribution function and moments of the underlying non linear multidimensional diffusion process. This so called moment method works for general conductance-based systems and an application is presented for the Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal model. Statistical properties obtained from the moment method are compared with direct numerical integration of the stochastic system. The firing probability due to external noise is derived as a closed formula. Results are given for different forms of the deterministic component of the stimulus. A generalization to neural networks of conductance-based systems with internal currents perturbed by noise can be obtained using the same approach. In the case of fully connected networks, a mean field population equation is derived which may be compared to Kuramoto's master equation for weakly coupled neural oscillators.},

	Abstract = {We consider a spatial neuron model in which the membrane potential satisfies a linear cable equation with an input current which is a dynamical random process of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) type. This form of current may represent an approximation to that resulting from the random opening and closing of ion channels on a neuron's surface or to randomly occurring synaptic input currents with exponential decay. We compare the results for the case of an OU input with those for a purely white-noise-driven cable model. The statistical properties, including mean, variance and covariance of the voltage response to an OU process input in the absence of a threshold are determined analytically. The mean and the variance are calculated as a function of time for various synaptic input locations and for values of the ratio of the time constant of decay of the input current to the time constant of decay of the membrane voltage in the physiological range for real neurons. The limiting case of a white-noise input current is obtained as the correlation time of the OU process approaches zero. The results obtained with an OU input current can be substantially different from those in the white-noise case. Using simulation of the terms in the series representation for the solution, we estimate the interspike interval distribution for various parameter values, and determine the effects of the introduction of correlation in the synaptic input stochastic process.},

	Abstract = {We present for the first time an analytical approach for determining the time of firing of multicomponent nonlinear stochastic neuronal models. We apply the theory of first exit times for Markov processes to the Fitzhugh-Nagumo system with a constant mean gaussian white noise input, representing stochastic excitation and inhibition. Partial differential equations are obtained for the moments of the time to first spike. The observation that the recovery variable barely changes in the prespike trajectory leads to an accurate one-dimensional approximation. For the moments of the time to reach threshold, this leads to ordinary differential equations that may be easily solved. Several analytical approaches are explored that involve perturbation expansions for large and small values of the noise parameter. For ranges of the parameters appropriate for these asymptotic methods, the perturbation solutions are used to establish the validity of the one-dimensional approximation for both small and large values of the noise parameter. Additional verification is obtained with the excellent agreement between the mean and variance of the firing time found by numerical solution of the differential equations for the one-dimensional approximation and those obtained by simulation of the solutions of the model stochastic differential equations. Such agreement extends to intermediate values of the noise parameter. For the mean time to threshold, we find maxima at small noise values that constitute a form of stochastic resonance. We also investigate the dependence of the mean firing time on the initial values of the voltage and recovery variables when the input current has zero mean.},

	Abstract = {For the Fitzhugh-Nagumo system with space-time white noise, we use numerical methods to consider the generation of action potentials and the reliability of transmission in the presence of noise. The accuracy of simulated solutions is verified by comparison with known exact analytical results. Noise of small amplitude may prevent transmission directly, whereas larger-amplitude noise may also interfere by producing secondary nonlocal responses. The probability of transmission as a function of noise amplitude is found for both uniform noise and noise restricted to a patch. For certain parameter ranges, the recovery variable may be neglected to give a single-component nonlinear diffusion with space-time white noise. In this case, analytical results are obtained for small perturbations and noise, which agree well with simulation results. For the voltage, variable expressions are given for the mean, covariance, and variance and their steady-state forms. The spectral density of the voltage is also obtained. Numerical examples are given of the difference between the properties of nonlinear and linear cables, and the validity of the expressions obtained for the statistical properties is investigated as a function of noise amplitude. For given parameters, analytical results are in good agreement with simulation until a certain critical noise amplitude is reached, which can be estimated. The role of trigger zones in increasing the reliability of transmission is discussed.},

	Abstract = {We examine the effects of stochastic input currents on the firing behaviour of two coupled Type 1 or Type 2 neurons. In Hodgkin-Huxley model neurons with standard parameters, which are Type 2, in the bistable regime, synaptic transmission can initiate oscillatory joint spiking, but white noise can terminate it. In Type 1 cells (models), typified by a quadratic integrate and fire model, synaptic coupling can cause oscillatory behaviour in excitatory cells, but Gaussian white noise can again terminate it. We locally determine an approximate basin of attraction, [see text] of the periodic orbit and explain the firing behaviour in terms of the effects of noise on the probability of escape of trajectories from [see text].},

For the networks, we are able to place a lower limit on the number of steady states and stron restrictions on the phase relations between components on cycles and transients. The logical structure and the dynamical behavior for a number of simple systems of biological interest, the feedback (predator-prey) oscillator, the bistable switch, the phase dependent switch, are discussed. We discuss the possibility that these tehniques may be extended to study the dynamics of large many component systems. },

	Abstract = {Neurons are often modeled by dynamical systems--parameterized systems of differential equations. A typical behavioral pattern of neurons is periodic spiking; this corresponds to the presence of stable limit cycles in the dynamical systems model. The phase resetting and phase response curves (PRCs) describe the reaction of the spiking neuron to an input pulse at each point of the cycle. We develop a new method for computing these curves as a by-product of the solution of the boundary value problem for the stable limit cycle. The method is mathematically equivalent to the adjoint method, but our implementation is computationally much faster and more robust than any existing method. In fact, it can compute PRCs even where the limit cycle can hardly be found by time integration, for example, because it is close to another stable limit cycle. In addition, we obtain the discretized phase response curve in a form that is ideally suited for most applications. We present several examples and p},

	Abstract = {A simple encoder model, which is a reasonable idealization from known electrophysiological properties, yields a population in which the variation of the firing rate with time is a perfect replica of the shape of the input stimulus. A population of noise-free encoders which depart even slightly from the simple model yield a very much degraded copy of the input stimulus. The presence of noise improves the performance of such a population. The firing rate of a population of neurons is related to the firing rate of a single member in a subtle way.},
